    "predicted_text": "Studies show that you may be lied to every day anywhere from 10 to 200 times. We say, \"Nice song.\" \"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.\" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're married, you're going to lie to your wife/husband in one out of every 10 communications. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. But look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth about lying: lying's a cooperative act. Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing to lie for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a private secret.\n\nLying is complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and business lives. We're deeply disturbed by the truth. We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives. We're against lying, but secretly we're for it in ways that our society has practiced for centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture and history. Think the stories from Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.\n\nLying has great value to the evolution of human being. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the more likely it is to lie. We human like to become leaders. It starts really early. How early? Well, babies will pretend to cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn hiding truth. Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright and try to control via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of covering up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world to be breadwinners, we've entered a world that is just full of fake digital friends, business media, identity thieves, world-class cheats, ----in short, a post-truth society.\n\nWhat do you do? Well there are steps we can take to guide our way through the bushes. Trained lie spotters get to the truth 90% of the time. The rest of us, we're only 54% accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are clever liars and stupid liars. There're no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques."

    "predicted_text": "You could feel sorry for Alberto Torres, who is blind. The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres’s wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres’s good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt.\n\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. “These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,” he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. “When you’re blind, it takes a little longer to do things,” he said.\n\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\n\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can’t see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. “Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,” it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. “We find what a person can do rather than what he can’t do,” said the hospital’s director.\n\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres’s hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. “If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there.” he said. “I’m not doing anything out of the ordinary,” insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task."

You may use a piano or any other musical instrument, if someone can play it. You may use a tape recorder. You can even use a radio.\n\nPut the chairs in a row. The chairs may be put in twos, back to back. A better way is to have the chairs in one row with each chair facing in the opposite direction to the chair next to it.\n\nThe game is easy. When the music starts, the players walk round the chairs. Everyone goes in the same direction, of course, they should walk in time to the music. If the music is fast they should walk quickly. If the music is slow, they should walk slowly.\n\nThe person playing music cannot see the people in the game. When the music stops, the players try to sit on the chairs. If a person cannot find a chair to sit on, he drops out. Then, before the music starts again, one chair must be taken away. When the music stops again, one more player will be out. At last, there will be two players and one chair. The one who sits on the chair when the music stops is the winner."

    "predicted_text": "Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He stopped by the fence in front of the house where he lived with his aunt Polly. He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down.\n\nHe knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire.\n\nHe put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets — nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea.\n\nAt this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash.\n\nWhile Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said “Ding-Dong-Dong”, “Ding-Dong-Dong” again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises. When he came close to Tom, he stopped.\n\nTom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: “Hello! I’m going swimming, but you can’t go, can you?”\n\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working.\n\nBen said, “Hello, old fellow, you’ve got to work, hey?”\n\nTom turned suddenly and said, “Why, it’s you, Ben! I wasn’t noticing.”\n\n“Say — I’m going swimming. Don’t you wish you could? But of course you’d rather work — wouldn’t you? Of course you would.”\n\nTom looked at the boy a bit, and said “What do you call work?”\n\n“Why, isn’t that work?”\n\nTom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly.\n\n“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn’t. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.”\n\n“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to say that you like it?”\n\nThe brush continued to move.\n\n“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I shouldn’t like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?”\n\nBen stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said,\n\n“Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.”\n\nTom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind.\n\n“No — no — it won’t do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don’t think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.”\n\n“No — is that so? Oh come, now — let me just try. Only just a little.” “Ben, I’d like to, but if it isn’t done right, I’m afraid Aunt Polly …”\n\n“Oh, I’ll be careful. Now let me try. Say — I’ll give you the core of my apple.”\n\n“Well, here — No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afraid …”\n\n“I’ll give you all of it.”\n\nTom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart. And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun, Tom sat under a tree, eating the apple, and planning how to get more help. There were enough boys. Each one came to laugh, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired, Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite; and when Billy was tired, Johnny bought in for a dead rat — and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, Tom had won many treasures.\n\nAnd he had not worked. He had had a nice idle time all the time, with plenty of company — and the fence had been whitewashed three times. If he hadn’t run out of whitewash, Tom would have owned everything belonging to his friends.\n\nHe had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get."

In the Three Kingdoms Period, Lu Su, General of Wu State, trained his soldiers here.\n\nIn 716, Kaiyuan of Tang Dynasty, General Zhang Shuo was sent to defend at Yuezhou and he rebuilt it into a tower named South Tower, and then Yueyang Tower. In 1044, Song Dynasty, Teng Zijing was stationed at Baling Jun, the ancient name of Yueyang City. In the second year, he had the Yueyang Tower repaired and had poems by famous poets written on the walls of the tower. Fan Zhongyan, a great artist and poet, was invited to write the well-known poem about Yueyang Tower. In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower (<<>>), Fan writes: \"Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land, the last to enjoy universal happiness.\" His words have been well-known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before.\n\nThe style of Yueyang Tower is quite special. The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories, flying eave and wood construction, the helmet-roof of such a large size is a rarity among the ancient architectures in China.\n\nEntering the tower, you'll see \"Dongting is the water of the world, Yueyang is the tower of the world\". Moving on, there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three-Kingdom Period general Lu Su. To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion in honor of Du Fu. Stepping out of the Xiaoxiang Door, the Xianmei Pavilion and the Sanzui Pavilion can be seen standing on two sides. In the garden to the north of the tower is the tomb of Xiaoqiao, the wife of Zhou Yu."

    "predicted_text": "People with disabilities make up a large part of the population. It is estimated that over 35 million Americans have physical, mental, or other disabilities. About half of these disabilities are \"developmental,\" i.e., they occur before the individual's twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered \"adventitious,\" i.e., accidental or caused by outside forces.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\n\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\n\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level.\n\nSignificant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society. For example, while no longer prohibited by law from marrying, a person with no access to transportation is effectively excluded from community and social activities which might lead to the development of long-term relationships.\n\nOnly when public attitudes advance as far as laws have will disabled people be fully able to take their rightful place in society."

Suddenly, she could hear another sound, so she opened her eyes and looked down at the sand. It was moving! All of a sudden she could see a tiny head coming out. Then a turtle appeared! One by one they struggled out of their underground nests. Mira looked in surprise at the baby turtles.\n\nMira knew the turtles should head towards the waves and swim away, so she was puzzled when they began to pull themselves towards the dunes. Suddenly, she remembered something her grandmother had told her.\n\n\"Sea turtles bury their eggs on the beach every year in April and in September. Those baby turtles hatch and head back down to the sea. But some of them never make it. Sometimes they die going across the dunes, trying to find those bright lights on the houses. Every day there are more houses being built on the dunes. That means more and more lights to confuse the sea turtles.\"\n\nMira looked out across the dunes at her house. Mira saw her mother and father, sitting on the porch. She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch.\n\nMira began to run to her house and shouted, \"The turtles are hatching! We have to help the turtles!\" With these words, Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights.\n\nIn a rush she was off running down the dunes with her whole family following her. They reached the beach just in time to see the tiny turtles slipping silently into the waves. Mira watched as the last turtle entered the water. As the turtle swam away, it looked back at Mira. In the moonlight, Mira thought she saw it smile."

His food-loving family had two kitchens, and he quickly learned what was the best way to bake his cakes. Lieberman improved his kitchen skills during a year abroad before college, learning from a cook in Italy and study local specialties in Germany, Spain and France. At Yale, he was known for throwing dinner parties, single-handedly frying and baking while mixing drinks for dozens of friends. Just for fun, he and some friends decided to tape a show named Campus Cuisine about his cooking. Lieberman was a real college student showing his classmate how to do things like making drinks out of dining-hall fruit. That helped the show become very popular among the students. They would stop Lieberman after classes to ask for his advice on cooking. Tapes of the show were passed around, with which his name went beyond the school and finally to the Food Network.\n\nFood Network producer Flay hopes the young cook will find a place on the network television. He says Lieberman's charisma is key. \"Food T-V isn't about food anymore,\" says Flay, \"It's about your personality and finding a way to keep people's eyeballs on your show.\"\n\nBut Lieberman isn't putting all his eggs in one basket. After taping the first season of the new show, Lieberman was back in his own small kitchen preparing sandwiches. An airline company was looking for someone to come up with a tasteful, inexpensive and easy-to-make menu to serve on its flight. Lieberman got the job."

The test preparation time is open to all students, and we strongly encourage your children to attend.\n\nThis year we are changing the time for our test preparation: it will be on Thursday mornings from 8:10 to 8:50. This helps children who ride the bus and cannot stay for the after-school period. It also helps avoid conflicts with after-school activities.\n\nDanielle and Marina will be working with the recent new test takers 6 days on the following Thursdays: 15th, Nov; 29th, Nov; 6th, Dec; 13th, Dec.; 20th, Dec. and 3rd, Jan.\n\nBesides the test preparation lectures on these dates, teachers are already putting test preparation into their usual courses. We are finding that we can help our students to be both skillful and whole-hearted readers and test takers -- after all, we all know that the best test preparation is good reading and writing training.\n\nWhat can you do at home? Again, the best and most effective test preparation for the ELA test is reading and more reading. The research is quite clear -- students who do well in the tests are those who are good readers. Reading not only builds reading ability, it also helps build confidence -- important for successful test taking! But do discourage your children from spending too much time on books that are too hard or even a bit too hard. Children best develop comprehension skills when they are reading books just right for them (too easy doesn't hurt here either).\n\nFinally, on Friday, December 7, we will have a morning lecture on the ELA. Please pay attention!"

The doctors said there was little chance of my coming out of it, but my identical twin, Marcus, didn't believe them and carried on talking to me. My first words when I came to myself were, \"Hello, Marcus.\" Even though I had no memory of my own name, or that the woman crying at my bedside was my mother, I knew Marcus immediately; it was like a genetic memory. I just felt close to him.\n\nAs weeks went by, I still could remember nothing before the accident. Marcus was the only person I could relate to.\n\nI had to relearn everything, and Marcus helped me. Because of my twin I wasn't scared of having lost my memory; I believed everything he said. He became my memory, telling me about my school, friends, previous girlfriends and holidays, showing me family photographs, and telling me how perfect I was.\n\nWith his encouragement I slowly recovered and tried to become the person everyone around me loved. Then years later, when my memories flooded back, I learned that I was anything but perfect—I was troublesome, selfish, and now very angry with Marcus for having lied to me.\n\nBut finally I understood. Out of love, Marcus had chosen not to tell me about my dark side. He wanted me to have a fresh start—and in fact I had one. Thanks to him, I was able to get married and have kids. I'm 46 now, and feel as if I'm in the third stage of my life. I know all there is to know, and wouldn't want it any other way."

    "predicted_text": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers. The answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\n\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8, 1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\n\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\n\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed. Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\n\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\n\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\n\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said, \"Thanks for being here.\"\n\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\n\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\n\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that—just be there when someone needed me.\n\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organize them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\n\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve."

We have the capacity to live in a way that these 24 hours will bring peace, joy, and happiness to ourselves and to others. Peace is right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do and see. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We don't have to travel far away to enjoy the blue sky. We don't have to leave our city or even our neighborhood to enjoy the eyes of a beautiful child. Even the air we breathe can be a source of joy. We can smile, breathe, walk, and eat our meals in a way that allows us to be in touch with the abundance of happiness that is available. We are very good at preparing how to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get it. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with joy, peace, and serenity. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment.\n\nPassage 2\nThe challenge of both is that we were but to open ourselves to the richness of the moment, to concentrate on it, we would be filled with bliss. I have lived in the present from time to time and can tell you that it is much overrated. Occasionally, as a holiday from stroking one's memories or brooding about future worries, I grant you, it can be a nice change of pace. But to \"be here now,\" hour after hour, would never work. I don't even approve of stories written in the present tense. Ads for poets who never use a past participate, they deserve the eternity they are striving for. Besides, the present has a way of intruding whether you like it or not. Why should I go out of my way to meet it? Let it splash on me from time to time, like a car going through a puddle, and I, on the sidewalk of my solitude, will salute it grimly like any other modern inconvenience. If I attend a concert, obviously not to listen to the music but to find a place in which to meditate on the past and future. I realize that there may be moments when the music invades my ears and I am forced to pay attention to it, note for note. I believe I take such intrusions gracefully. The present is not always unwelcome, so long as it doesn't stay too long and cut into my remembering or brooding time."

    "predicted_text": "A person named Bernard Jackson today is a free man, but he has many bitter memories. He spent five years in prison after a jury wrongly convicted him of raping two women. At Jackson's trial, although two witnesses testified that Jackson was with them in another location at the time of the crime, he was convicted anyway. Why? The jury believed the testimony of the two victims, who positively identified Jackson as the man who had attacked them. The court eventually freed Jackson after the police found the real criminal.\n\nMany factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses sometimes see photographs of several suspects before they try to identify the person they saw in a group of people. They can become confused by seeing many photographs of similar faces. The number of people in the group, and whether it is a person or a photograph, may also affect a witness's decision. People sometimes have difficulty identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them.\n\nMany people believe that police officers are more reliable than ordinary people. Psychologists decided to test this idea, and they discovered that it is not true. Two psychologists showed a film of crimes to both police officers and civilians. The psychologists found no difference between the police and the civilians in correctly remembering the details of the crimes.\n\nDespite all the possibilities for inaccuracy, courts cannot omit eyewitness testimony from a trial. American courts depend almost completely on eyewitness testimony to resolve court cases. Sometimes it is the only evidence to a crime, such as rape. Furthermore, eyewitness testimony is often correct. Although people do sometimes make mistakes, and convict innocent people, more importantly, eyewitness testimony has rightly convicted a larger number of guilty people.\n\nAmerican courts depend on the ability of the twelve jurors, and not the judges, to determine the accuracy of the witness's testimony. It is their responsibility to decide if a certain witness could actually see, hear and remember what happened."

They dug holes all over Britain, hoping to find it.\n\nOne of the most popular adventure stories ever written is Robert Louis Stephenson's \"Treasured Island\", an exciting story about a young boy, Jim Hawkins, who is captured by pirates and later finds some buried treasure.\n\nThen there is the true story about a man who had to travel overseas for a year. He did not trust banks, so he buried his life savings in a park. Then he went away. On his return, he went straight to the park. But the park was no longer there. In its place there was a huge building.\n\nAnd then there was the man who buried his savings, all in bank notes, in a waterproof bag. When he dug it up years later, there was nothing left. Worms and insects had eaten the bag and everything in it.\n\nAnd of course, these are stories about people who bury things and either forget where they have buried them or lose the map.\n\nAlthough it is true that people sometimes lose their money because a bank fails, banks are still the safest place to keep our savings and treasures."

Some want technical improvements such as quieter air conditioners or better sound barriers around major roads. Others want tougher laws to restrict noise from building sites or to require owners to take responsibility for barking dogs. But the highest priority was a noise complaints system that works.\n\nBrisbane City Council receives more complaints about noise than all other problems put together. So it conducted a survey and found that about half its residents are upset by noise in one form or another—traffic, mowers, pool pumps, air conditioners or loud parties. This inspired the Council to bring together more than 100 citizens one evening to talk through a range of options.\n\nThe meeting found the present regulatory system bizarre. Depending on the problem, responsibility for noise can lie with the Council, the Environment Protection Authority, one of three government departments or even the police. So complainants often feel they are getting the run-around. When the people at the forum were asked to vote for changes, the strongest response was for a 24-hour noise hotline to be the first port of call for all complaints.\n\nThe forum also favored regulatory measures, such as tougher minimum standards for noise in appliances like air conditioners. This even makes economic sense, as noise is a waste of energy and money. Other measures the meeting supported were wider buffer zones around noisy activities and controls to keep heavy traffic away from residential areas.\n\nBut there are obvious conflicts. Many people like to have a bar within walking distance if they feel like a drink, but they don't want a noisy pub keeping them awake when they want an early night. Most people want to live near a major road providing good access to other parts of the city, but they don't want the problem of road noise.\n\nI was most interested by the proposals aimed at behavioral change. There was strong support for measures to reduce traffic: better public transport, cycle ways and footpaths, even charges for road use. Many people optimistically thought industry awards for better equipment would stimulate the production of quieter appliances. It was even suggested that noise from building sites could be alleviated if Brisbane adopted daylight saving, thus shifting the working day and providing longer, quieter evenings."

Fire is one of man's greatest friends, but also one of his greatest enemies. Many big fires are caused by carelessness. A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire. Sometimes, though, a fire can start on its own. Wet hay can begin burning by itself. This is how it happens: the hay starts to rot and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it. Finally, it bursts into flames. That's why farmers cut and store their hay when it's dry.\n\nFires have destroyed whole cities. In the 17th century, a small fire which began in a baker's shop burnt down nearly every building in London. Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon. This fire continued burning for seven days. And, of course, in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome. Even today, in spite of modern fire-fighting methods, fire causes millions of pounds' worth of damage each year both in our cities and in the countryside. It has been wisely said that fire is a good servant but a bad master."

From a very young age, Artie Shaw wanted to play his clarinet better than anyone. He wanted his sound and music to be perfect. He worked at this task much of his life.\n\nHe began working as a professional musician when he was fifteen. He left home and began playing in bands across the United States.\n\nIn 1928, young Artie Shaw traveled to Chicago, Illinois to hear the great trumpet player, Louis Armstrong. He immediately understood that Armstrong's great jazz sound was the beginning of something new and exciting. Artie left Chicago with a growing interest in jazz music. Soon after, he moved to New York City.\n\nHe got work playing the clarinet for the Columbia Broadcast System radio network. In 1936, he was given a chance to form a small group and play at New York's famous Imperial Theater on Broadway. His group was not the top band in the show. But the crowd loved his music. This proved to be a major step in his career.\n\nArtie Shaw was always trying something new, something different. He heard a young black woman sing and hired her for his band. This was the first time that a black woman sang with white musicians. Racial separation was the rule in many states. Artie Shaw did not care.\n\nArtie Shaw wrote several books in his later years. He wrote stories for magazines. He spoke about music at colleges and universities. But he had very little to do with the world of recording or music. During those years however, he received many awards and honors for his music. These included a Hall of Fame award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences."

My characteristic optimism was alive only when I reminded myself that I would be doing what I had wanted to do since I was fourteen — teaching English.\n\nSchool started, but I felt more and more as if I were in a foreign country. Was this rural area really New Jersey? My students took a week off when hunting season began. I was told they were also frequently absent in late October to help their fathers make hay on the farms. I was a young woman from New York City, who thought that “Make hay while the sun shines” just meant to have a good time.\n\nBut, still, I was teaching English. I worked hard, taking time off only to eat and sleep. And then there was my sixth-grade class — seventeen boys and five girls who were only six years younger than me. I had a problem long before I knew it. I was struggling in my work as a young idealistic teacher. I wanted to make literature come alive and to promote a love of the written word. The students wanted to throw spitballs and whisper dirty words in the back of the room.\n\nIn college I had been taught that a successful educator should ignore bad behavior. So I did, confident that, as the textbook had said, the bad behavior would disappear if I gave my students positive attention. It sounds reasonable, but the text evidently ignored the fact that humans, particularly teenagers, rarely seem reasonable. By the time my boss, who was also my taskmaster, known to be the strictest, most demanding, most quick to fire inexperienced teachers, came into the classroom to observe me, the students exhibited very little good behavior to praise.\n\nMy boss sat in the back of the room. The boys in the class were making animal noises, hitting each other while the girls filed their nails or read magazines. I just pretended it all wasn’t happening, and went on lecturing and tried to ask some inspiring questions. My boss, sitting in the back of the classroom, seemed to be growing bigger and bigger. After twenty minutes he left, silently. Visions of unemployment marched before my eyes.\n\nI felt mildly victorious that I got through the rest of class without crying, but at my next free period I had to face him. I wondered if he would let me finish out the day. I walked to his office, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\n\nHe was sitting in his chair, and he looked at me long and hard. I said nothing. All I could think of was that I was not an English teacher; I had been lying to myself, pretending that everything was fine.\n\nWhen he spoke, he said simply, without accusation, “You had nothing to say to them.”\n\n“You had nothing to say to them,” he repeated. “No wonder they are bored. Why not get to the meat of literature and stop talking about symbolism. Talk with them, not at them. And more important, why do you ignore their bad behavior?” We talked. He named my problems and offered solutions. We role-played. He was the bad student, and I was the forceful, yet, warm teacher.\n\nAs the year progressed, we spent many hours discussing literature and ideas about human beings and their motivations. He helped me identify my weaknesses and strengths. In short, he made a teacher of me by teaching me the reality of Emerson’s words: “The secret to education lies in respecting the pupil.”\n\nFifteen years later I still drive that same winding road to the same school. Thanks to the help I received that difficult first year, the school is my home now."

But scientists and archeologists now agree that women invented one very important thing. It had changed the history. They invented agriculture.\n\nBefore the invention of agriculture men were hunter. They went out every day. Sometimes they killed animals—sometimes animals killed them. Life was difficult and dangerous. Women had to go out every day, too. They collected roots, fruit and grass. Then, one day, more than 10,000 years ago a woman dropped some grass seeds. She dropped them near her home in the Middle East. They grew—and the first wheat was born. The idea grew, too. Women planted roots and fruit trees. Then they could stay at home and look after the children and the animals. Women liked baby animals: dogs, cows, sheep and goats. That idea grew, too. Then their husbands did not have to go hunting for meat. They stayed at home. They built villages and cities. Men began civilization—after women invented agriculture."

Several operations and speech classes later, when she was seven, we found out that Jenny had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. She could not put pressure on the heels of her feet, so she walked on tiptoe, and when the pain became unbearable, I carried her. Jenny was fortunate, though, because she did not suffer the deformities, often associated with JRA. All through grade school, and on into high school, Jenny suffered, yet never complained. She took her medicine, and I would often wrap her feet in steaming towels, and hold her until the pain eased. But, as soon as she could stand the pain, Jenny, immediately, carried on, as though she were pain-free. She wore a smile on her face, a song on her lips, and a love and acceptance of others. That was simply amazing. She ran, when she could run. She played when she could play, and she danced when she could dance. And, when she could do none of these things, she took her medicine, and she waited until she could. Jenny, a beautiful girl with warm brown eyes, was never a cheerleader. She never competed in a sport. She joined the band. She won a place in the Governor’s School for the Arts; yet, no one in the Charleston, South Carolina School System knew what to do with Jenny. The perimeters were, simply, not in place to deal with a student, who was both active and disabled. Jenny continued to have one operation after another on her ears, all through school. Her hearing improved to 60%, and she taught herself to read lips. At school she was popular, attending every football game to cheer the team on. She carried her pillow everywhere she went, so that she could reduce the pain when she sat down. Then came her senior year in high school. She liked school activities, especially sports. So she began to bombard the school football coach. Finally the coach gave in, with the warning: “If you miss ONE game, you’re out!” So, Jenny became Manager of Garrett High School Football Team. She carried big buckets of water to her teammates. She bandaged knees and ankles before every game. She gave inspiring talks and it turned out to be one of the best years for Garrett High School football Team in its history. When asked why he thought that the team was winning all their games, one team member Jack explained, “Well, when you’ve been knocked down, and you can’t seem to move, you look up and see Jenny Lewis, walking across the field, dragging her buckets and carrying her pillow. It makes anything the rest of us may suffer seem pretty unimportant.” At the Senior Awards ceremony, Jenny received a number of scholarships to College of Charleston. Her favorite scholarship, however, was a small one from the Charleston Women’s Club. The President of the Women’s Club listed Jenny’s achievements, starting with her grades, and ending with an excited: “…and the first girl to letter in football, in Garrett High School history!”"

Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since 1719, when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n\nNear the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Fernandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\n\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support.\n\nDefoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality. Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe's time."

After 221 years, The Times has changed its size to become much smaller. In fact, the paper has cut its size in half from a broadsheet to tabloid.\n\nIn Britain, the newspaper market is divided between the larger broadsheets and the smaller tabloids. These terms refer to the size of the papers’ pages but there is also a clear difference in content. Broadsheets such as The Times, the Guardian and Daily Telegraph are serious papers. They cover a broad range of political, economic and international issues. Their stories are also reasonably long and use quite formal language.\n\nTabloids have far more stories about less serious issues such as celebrities’ love lives. Their stories are shorter and use more simple language. Tabloids often have bigger pictures. Britain’s best-selling newspaper, the Sun, is a tabloid and has a naked girl on Page Three every day.\n\nBy changing to the size of a tabloid, The Times is following in the footsteps of a less famous broadsheet paper, the Independent. It changed to tabloid last year and saw its sales increase greatly. Although both papers have switched to the smaller size, the content of the papers has remained the same. They are both still serious papers.\n\nThe two papers claim that people find the smaller size easier to handle when they travel to work on the bus or the train in the morning. Instead of calling the new style of their paper tabloid, the paper says its new size is “compact”."

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition and heat-related health problems.\n\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\n\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.\n\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum’s report was “a methodological embarrassment” because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable regions. Dr. Pielke said that “climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.” But the report, he said, “will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed.”\n\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.\n\nIn a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report."

Linguists celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16, 2008. After the Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary, rather than rely on British versions. He dropped the British \"u\" in some words. And he changed \"centre\" into \"center\" for children to learn English by spelling words more like they sounded.\n\nWebster wasn't shy about expressing his opinions. In defining preposterous (unreasonable), he wrote: \"A Republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\"\n\nWebster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom.\n\n\"He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,\" said Joshua Kendall, who is working on a biography about Webster. \"He at last got us united through our language.\""

Actually, most people experience nervousness at some time or another.\n\nIf you are feeling anxious, my advice is to first find the cause or causes. Make a list of those things that are making you nervous and work out which ones you can do something about. Focus all of your efforts on managing the causes that you can control.\n\nMost people cannot tell the difference between controllable and uncontrollable causes, so things they can't control become a big reason for nervousness. Dealing with this is very important if people want to keep a healthy mind.\n\nSimply try to accept the uncontrollable causes of nervousness. You might be worried about the weather on a big day, an accident or an attack on the train, or perhaps just things that other people are doing at work. The results may be very important but there is still no use worrying because you can't control any of these things. Accept that you can't control everything. Once you understand this, it becomes easier not to worry.\n\nIf a situation, such as swimming, is causing you to be anxious, try to face it as often as possible so that you can get used to it.\n\nIt can often help to think about yourself doing the thing that makes you nervous—then close your eyes and imagine it going well. Imagine how the flight or job interview is going to happen so that you can get used to it. This will help you understand that the thing you fear most is probably not going to happen."

Many people feel that the United States has the worst taxes in the world.\n\nTaxes are the money that people pay to support their government. There are generally three levels of government in the United States: federal, state, and city; therefore, there are three types of taxes.\n\nSalaried people who can earn more than four to five thousand dollars per year must pay a certain part. It depends on their salaries. The federal government has a two-level income tax that is 15 or 28 percent. $17,850 is the cut off. The tax rate is 15 percent below $17,850 and 28 percent above.\n\nThe second tax is for the state government: New York, California, or any of the other forty-eight states. Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government. Of course, the percentage for the state tax is lower. Other states have a sales tax, which is a percentage charged to any item which people buy in the state. Some states use income tax and sales tax to raise their revenues (annual income).\n\nThe third tax is for the city. This tax comes in two forms: property tax (people who own a home have to pay taxes on it) and excise tax, which is collected on vehicles in a city. The cities use this money for education, police, public works, etc.\n\nSince Americans pay such high taxes, they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes. People always complain about taxes. They often say that the government misuses their tax dollars. They all believe that taxes are too high in this country."

Some women say they need time to be alone.\n\nAt Mother's Camp a woman has room to herself. She can sleep, read or watch TV, and no one will bother her. No children will ask, \"Mom, what's for dinner?\" No husband will say, \"Oh, dear, I can't find any clean socks.\" In fact almost 50% of women in the United States work outside the home. Many of them work full-time and then come home to a second job—taking care of their homes and families. These working women say one of their biggest problems is housework.\n\nIn the United States, working wives do about 75% of the housework. Many of their husbands say they want to help. But then they burn the rice or they can't find the pans. They ask so many questions that their wives decide it is easier to do the job themselves.\n\nSome women go to Mother's Camp just to get a break from housework. For two days they don't cook, they don't clean, they don't look after their children and husbands. What do they do? They enjoy warm, sunny weather, walking, swimming or boating in a clear blue lake and sing songs around the campfire. They relax away from home.

This was expressed by the equation E = mc². But bombs were not what Einstein had in mind when he published this equation.\n\nIn 1929, he publicly declared that if a war broke out he would \"refuse to do war service, direct or indirect....\" His position would change in 1933, as the result of Adolf Hitler's coming into power in Germany.\n\nEinstein's greatest role in the invention of the atomic bomb was signing a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging that the bomb be built because some physicists feared that Germany might be working on an atomic bomb. Among those concerned were physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner. But they had no influence with those in power. So in July 1939 they explained the problem to someone who did: Albert Einstein. After talking with Einstein, in August 1939 Szilard wrote a letter to President Roosevelt with Einstein's signature on it, which was delivered to Roosevelt in October 1939.\n\nGermany had invaded Poland the previous month, the time was ripe for action. That October research of a-bomb began but proceeded slowly because the invention of the atomic bomb seemed distant and unlikely. In April 1940 an Einstein letter, ghost-written by Szilard, pressed the researchers on the need for \"greater speed\".\n\nAs the realization of nuclear weapons grew near, Einstein looked beyond the current war to future problems that such weapons could bring. He wrote to his friend about his fear about the future use of the a-bomb.\n\nThe atomic bombings of Japan occurred three months after Germany gave in.\n\nIn November 1954, five months before his death, Einstein summarized his feelings about his role in the creation of the atomic bomb: \"I made one great mistake in my life...when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification---the danger that the Germans would make them?\""

While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. The cup that you're drinking from adds nothing to the quality of the hot chocolate. In most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink. What all of you really wanted was hot chocolate, not the cup; but you consciously went for the best cups...

The cup you have does not define, nor change the quality of life you have. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the hot chocolate we have.

But when British people say that their society is based on family life, they are thinking of \"family\" in its narrow, peculiarly European sense of mother, father and children living together alone in their own house as an economic and social unit. Thus, every British marriage indicates the beginning of a new and independent family--hence the tremendous importance of marriage in British life. For both the man and the woman, marriage means leaving one's parents and starting one's own life. The man's first duty will then be to his wife, and the wife's to her husband. He will be entirely responsible for her financial support, and she for the running of the new home. Their children will be their common responsibility and theirs alone. Neither the wife's parents nor the husband's, nor their brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, have any right to interfere with them--they are their own masters.\n\nReaders of novels like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice will know that in former times marriage among wealthy families were arranged by the girl's parents, that is, it was the parents' duty to find a suitable husband for their daughter, preferably a rich one, and by skillful encouragement to lead him eventually to ask their permission to marry her. Until that time, the girl was protected and maintained in the parents' home, and the financial relief of getting rid of her could be seen in their giving the newly married pair a sum of money called a dowry. It is very different today. Most girls of today get a job when they leave school and become financially independent before their marriage. This has had two results. A girl chooses her own husband, and she gets no dowry."

Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.\n\nSlow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking—the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place's natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games.\n\n\"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It's not something you do quickly and then you're on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.\n\n\"When you stand below the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael's Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree. But reaching the treetop, he adds, is an entirely different feeling. Likewise, his wife, Viola Brumbaugh, kneels on the ground and asks Michael's Triumph for permission to climb. \"It goes a lot smoother that way,\" She says.\n\nAnd climbing has been included into many educational programs. New Tribe offers guided climbs through its school, Tree Climbing Northwest, where \"we teach enough tree biology and forest ecology to raise awareness in our students,\" says New Tribe present Sophis Sparks. \"We know that the tree climbing experience deepens personal appreciation for trees. After climbing, people value trees more and are motivated to support preservation. This is not just to preserve their playground.\"\n\nPerhaps that is why he struggles with the term \"recreational tree climbing,\" saying, \"I prefer to call it inspirational tree climbing.\""

Whitehill's achievement marked a major step forward in the way people could one day learn by establishing facial expression recognition in robot teachers.\n\nThe teaching robots or, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computer systems that provide personalized instruction and feedback to students without human intervention. The facial expression recognition allows a computer to react according to expressions a user makes.\n\nHe said that the system was an important development in improving learning systems.\n\n\"Classical ITS typically have a somewhat rigid architecture of 'first I ask a question, then I wait for a response, then I talk some more; then I wait for another response.' Facial expression recognition, I believe, will allow the feedback from student to teacher to happen while the robot teacher is talking,\" Whitehill said.\n\nExperts agree the latest developments in ITS open new possibilities for how people could learn. University of Memphis researcher, Dr Andrew Olney, who recently received a US$1.3 million grant to develop an ITS, said the key to future learning will be enabling interactive, one-on-one instruction.\n\n\"The technology can benefit these more advanced learning scenarios,\" he said.\n\nAlthough robot teachers of varying abilities have existed for more than 30 years, ITS developments such as Whitehill's and Olney's are pushing beliefs that robots could soon be as effective as— if not more effective than— human teachers.\n\n\"The ITS which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience,\" Olney said."

The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. He was also very angry.\n\nPaul Newman's camp counselors were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n\nThen something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\".\n\nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend time together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\n\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his corner to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief. I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\n\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on the table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\n\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released.\n\nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\n\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. I said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\n\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\n\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n\nThe show had begun: lights, camera, action.\n\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\n\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. I was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears. After the hug and kiss, he put his hands on my shoulders, and tears still in his eyes, said: \"See you on the other side of the door, Fatha.\""

And although it was very expensive, it quickly became popular. In London, shops where chocolate drinks were served became important places. Some still exist today. The potato is also from the New World. Around 1600, the Spanish brought it from Peru to Europe, where it soon was widely grown. Ireland became so dependent on it that thousands of Irish people starved when the crop failed during the years of 1845–1846, and thousands more were forced to go to live in America.\n\nThere are many other foods that have traveled from South America to the Old World. But some others went in the opposite direction. Brazil is now the world's largest grower of coffee, and coffee is an important crop in other South American countries. But it is native to Ethiopia.

Or they might use a computer to help them in their search for a soul mate by joining an online dating service. Some people have even tried to find their perfect match through game shows on television. Many of these TV dating shows, including The Bachelor and Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?, have proved to be popular, with millions of viewers watching each week to find out which of the contestants will find true love.\n\nOf all these game shows, perhaps the one with the most unexpected ending was Mr. Right, which was shown in England in 2002. On the show, a bachelor, thirty-five-year-old Lance Gerrard-Wright, dated fifteen women to find the one who was his ideal partner. The host of the show was Ulrika Jonsson, an English celebrity originally from Sweden. For seven weeks on the show, Lance took turns going on dates with each of the women, taking them to expensive restaurants and romantic locations. He even met the women's families and introduced them to his own. Then at the end of each episode, he would choose between one and three of the contestants with whom he had felt the least compatible, and say goodbye to them.\n\nAt one point during the series, one contestant volunteered to leave because she said she didn't find him attractive. After two dates she said she had had enough, and she couldn't see it working, \"He wasn't my cup of tea.\" In another episode the woman he was on a date with burst into tears when he called her by another girl's name. \"You called me by another girl's name. I can't believe you did that. I really liked you,\" she said in tears.\n\nBut in the final episode, the woman he eventually chose decided she didn't want to marry him after all. \"I think you've chosen me because you have to choose someone,\" she said. Maybe this was because she already knew he had fallen in love with the show's host!\n\nAfter leaving the show, Gerrard-Wright and Jonsson were seen dining together and attending parties around London more and more often. Finally, on May 1, 2003, Gerrard-Wright proposed to Jonsson on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. And she accepted his proposal right away, although she had to make sure that her two children from previous relationships—an eight-year-old son, Cameron, and a two-year-old daughter, Bo—agreed to the marriage. Luckily, they did. Gerrard-Wright said, \"In the end the show did work for me. I grabbed an opportunity to get a girlfriend and I did. Ulrika's amazing.\"\n\nThe happy couple finally got married at Jonsson's home in Sweden on the island of Varmdo. They wanted to keep the ceremony small, so only forty people were invited, including family and friends. There was some gossip at the time that Jonsson's friends who did not receive invitations to the wedding felt upset. But the bride and groom did not let that ruin their wedding day.\n\nHas Ulrika Jonsson finally found Mr. Right? Only time will tell. But none of the guests at the wedding could deny the happiness in the couple's eyes as the bride and groom left the wedding ceremony with the music of Stevie Wonder playing in the background, \"Seen a lot of things in this old world. When I touched them, they did nothing, girl. Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours.\""

The athletes then go on to famous sports universities, where they exhaust their playing years before landing back on the streets without job opportunity or college degrees.\n\nThe prep school scheme was meant to avoid academic qualification rules for college athletes made years ago by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A., which was slow to recognize the seriousness of the problem, has finally adopted policies to root it out. But those policies will not do the job unless everyone is involved, including prep schools and college athletics departments that still recruit students who do not meet academic standards.\n\nThe prep school scheme sends a dangerous message to poor neighborhoods, where young people too often ignore their studies, believing that they will magically become millionaires once the world sees their athletic talents. Even worse, it encourages students to drop out of traditional schools before graduation—at which point\n\nThe N.C.A.A. has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some. The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes’ transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average, transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term.\n\nThese measures are encouraging as far as they go. But the N.C.A.A. will need to go much deeper into the problem if it hopes to break this scheme. For starters, it needs to make clear not just what courses high school athletes need to take to become qualified for college sports, but when they should take them. Until that happens, those who recruit young athletes will always be tempted to make fake academic records at the last possible moment for them."

To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n\nFalls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision.\n\nBikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\n\nPedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior. Cross at the corner and when you do cross, continue to look both ways because there are likely to be more cars turning into your path or people speeding. Obey all the traffic signals."

We have already seen that people allow all sorts of waste products to flow into the sea. It is almost impossible to measure how much waste water and industrial waste in our oceans, but we can find out how much oil is poured into them legally and illegally. It is illegal to pour oil into the sea close to the shore, but when a ship is many miles out to sea, there are no such rules. Scientists have different ideas as to the amount of oil putting into the sea, but the lowest figure for oil poured in European waters alone is nearly 200,000 tons every year. Some people say the figure could be ten times as high. It is not only our coasts that suffer from oil pollution. Many shell fish, for example, now have high amounts of poisonous substances. Next time you have shell fish to eat, how can you be sure that they are free from oil pollution? You cannot see the effects and you cannot taste them, either. It is really quite a problem."

They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way.\n\nWhat makes a relationship healthy?\n\nCommunication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n\nRespect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.\n\nHow do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?\n\nYou know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.\n\nHealthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you.\n\nYou should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets. In a healthy relationship, you like to spend time with the other person, instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her."

Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity, the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to be consistent to a stereotype, a US study says. Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their abilities to express their emotions, rather than feeling they had to obey to the “boy code” of hiding their emotions to be a “real man”.\n\nThe findings of the study are against the received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls. Tony Little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being ignored by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.\n\nThe research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills. But in single-sex schools teachers can adjust lessons to boys’ learning styles, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study author, Abigail James of the University of Virginia.\n\nTeachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with “boy-focused” approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them. Because boys generally have sharper vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given hands-on lessons where they are allowed to walk around. Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modern type in which violence and sexism are major themes, James wrote.\n\nSingle-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to give in to a stereotype that men should be “masterful and in charge” in relationships. In mixed schools boys feel pressed to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means, the study reported."

If the present rate of smoking continues, the number of deaths each year from smoking could rise to 10 million by the year 2020.\n\nThe study describes smoking is the biggest cause of deadly diseases among grown-ups in industrial countries. So far most of the smoking deaths have happened to men, especially in developing countries.\n\nA researcher at the World Health Organization says 70% of Chinese men smoke more than 15 cigarettes each day. In Latin America about 50% of the men are smokers. There also are a very large number of smokers in Russia and in Eastern Europe. And 25% of all smoking deaths worldwide are in those areas of the world. Scientists say smoking will kill 50% of the smokers.\n\nSmoking is known to cause lung cancer. It also can lead to cancer of the mouth and other parts of bodies. Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to suffer from heart disease.\n\nExperts say that people reduce their chance of dying from smoking if they stop smoking completely. They say smokers who give up smoking can improve their health."

According to the British Heart Foundation (BHF), around 200,000 young people start smoking regularly in England each year and 11 per cent of 11-to-15-year-old regular smokers in England and Wales get their cigarettes from vending machines.\n\nBetty McBride, Director of Policy and Communications at the British Heart Foundation, said, \"Thousands of children who are at risk of addiction regularly get tobacco from these machines, which of course, don't ask them to prove their age. With the tobacco industry increasingly depending on young smokers to keep their profits, they're fighting tooth and nail to stop any changes that might hit their bottom line.\"\n\nThe ban, which makes it illegal to sell tobacco from vending machines and requires shopkeepers to ensure all tobacco advertising on the machines is removed, comes into force in England today. It is the first ban in Europe to prohibit selling cigarettes from vending machines, which shows the determination of England to fight against smoking.\n\nOther measures to protect young people from the dangers of smoking are also on the way. In April 2013 large retailers in England and Scotland will have to get rid of all tobacco displays and small shops will be expected to do that from April 2015. Wales and Northern Ireland also plan to make similar regulations.\n\nThe UK Government is due to begin a public consultation before the end of the year on whether to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes which would reduce their marketing appeal to young people, help to make health warnings more effective and, alongside other measures, help to reduce the number of smokers in the long term."

As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.\n\n\"All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'\" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. \"There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.\"\n\nNot all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research became prefix = st1 /NewSchoolUniversity to reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it the New School.\n\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has _ a new name: the New School. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"the New School\".\n\nChanges in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east of San Francisco.\n\nBeaver College turned itself into Arcadia University in 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and \"morning zoo\" radio shows.\n\nMany college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average student's test score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadia spokeswoman, said."

Now scientists say, it's a little bug that causes obesity.\n\nAs the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives, millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures. But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas turkey or hot chocolates, but some bacteria in your guts.\n\nChinese scientists recently discovered a type of bacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity. A research team led by Zhao Liping, a professor in Shanghai, has identified a precise link between a particular kind of bacteria and unusual weight gain.\n\n\"The endotoxin released by the bacterium can activate a gene that helps produce fat. And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat,\" Zhao says.\n\nScientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut, microbiota, may play a very important role in human health. In 2004, American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice.\n\nWhile a link was believed to exist, proving it was another matter.\n\n\"The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing,\" says Lita Proctor, director of the US National Institutes of Health. \"But the problem is that we're only able to look at associations and aren't yet able to conduct cause-and-effect studies.\"\n\nIn the clinical study, researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin-producing bacteria, leading to 35 percent of the gut bacteria, in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg.\n\nBased on this information, researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized nutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts.\n\nAfter 23 weeks, the patient lost 51.4 kg, with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared."

There were no luxuries, but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money.\n\nMy mother was beautiful with dark hair and brown eyes, but she was also quiet and shy. Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends.\n\nIt was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile.\n\nThen, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon.

Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents.\n\nThen there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke.

At a stated time all the citizens would assemble at a town meeting, where they would discuss local problems and express opinions freely. They also elected the town's officials at these gatherings and made decisions about the taxes they would pay and about other community matters. These meetings were usually held at the town hall, which was located in the central square.\n\nIn the eighteenth-century town meetings, only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted, although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions. Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\n\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television. Occasionally a meeting of this type is called by a government agency in order to give an opportunity for free and open discussion on current problems and policies."

But, on the other hand, offers of cheap alcohol in supermarkets will not be affected, which is widely regarded as one of the main sources of Britain's problems with under-age and over-drinking. Doctors and health experts argue that the government has failed to use its most effective weapon, the taxation of minimum price controls on alcohol.\n\nHome Secretary Alan Johnson said that the government and the industry had a duty to act on heavy drinking. \"These bans have a real impact on society, not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out,\" he said. \"The dentist's chair\", where drinks are poured directly into the mouth by others, was made famous by the celebrations of footballer Paul Gascoigne at Euro '96. That game and others that promote large consumption will be banned from April and publicans will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers.\n\nThe government says over-drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new mandatory code will face severe punishment. For instance, publicans and vendors could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds ($32,750) or face six months in prison."

A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees.\n\nThe researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams. Each match lasted an hour, divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge.\n\nObservers noted down the referees' errors, of which there were 61 over the tournament. Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes, each referee made almost 23 mistakes, a remarkably high number.\n\nThe researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail. Surprisingly, he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close to the incident. When the officials got it right, they were, on average, 17 meters away from the action. The average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters. The research shows the optimum distance is about 20 meters.\n\nThere also seemed to be an optimum speed. Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second. The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second.\n\nIf FIFA, football's international ruling body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup, it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance, rather than rushing to keep up with the ball, the researcher argues.\n\nHe also says that FIFA's insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided. If keeping up with the action is not so important, their physical condition is less critical."

    "predicted_text": "\"Hitler and the Germans,\" an exhibition in Berlin's German Historical Museum which aims to investigate the society that created Hitler, has seen more than 10,000 visitors walk through its doors since opening on Friday.\n\nRudolf Trabold, a spokesman for the museum, said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone. People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in. Ravi Nair, a 73-year-old Indian visitor, said: \"I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it. The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable.\"\n\nTrabold said \"Hitler and the Germans\" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years, in Vienna's men's hostels, could become an almost mythical leader of the German people. \"We are all affected by Hitler, so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past.\" Inge Lonning, a 72-year-old tourist from Norway said: \"I thought the exhibition was very impressive. I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child, so it's not just history for me.\" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition. \"So much has been done about this period over the years, it was like, I knew this and I knew that,\" said Canadian Julien Cayer, aged 28. \"I thought I'd find something new but I didn't.\"\n\nThere has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo-Nazi admirers of Hitler, but Trabold said that although there had been some right-wing activity, the exhibit remained secure."

We were living in College Station, Texas and my wife and I were on our way home from Houston, Texas one Sunday morning. We decided to stop at a local gas station to get something to eat since we had enough time.\n\nWhen we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as if he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something to drink. However, it was not this that moved me.\n\nA dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog lover, I noticed that the dog was a mother and that she had just had some puppies. She was hungry and weak and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not live on.\n\nPeople walking by didn't even notice her. She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still deserved better. But we still did not do anything, someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went back into a store and bought dog food with all the money he had.\n\nI know that this story isn't as inspirational as most stories, but it plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend. And a lot of people forget that some animals are parents too."

But can medicine come packaged in chicken eggs?\n\nA team of scientists from Scotland say \"yes\". They've engineered special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These eggs come from chickens that have been engineered to produce certain drugs inside their egg whites.\n\nThese drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins — they're the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good candidates for making protein drugs.\n\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA — the code that tells cells how to make proteins — so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs."

    "predicted_text": "I have only once been in trouble with the law. The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time, but it makes a good story now. What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both of my arrest and my subsequent fate in court.\n\nIt happened in February about twelve years ago. I had left school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October. I was still living at home at the time.\n\nOne morning I was in Richmond, a suburb of London near where I lived. I was looking for a temporary job so that I could save up some money to go traveling. As it was a fine day and I was in no hurry, I was taking my time, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me. It must have been this obvious aimlessness that led to my downfall.\n\nIt was about half past eleven when it happened. I was just walking out of the local library, having unsuccessfully sought employment there, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me. I thought he was going to ask me the time. Instead, he said he was a police officer and he was arresting me. At first I thought it was some kind of joke.\n\nBut then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform, and I was left in no doubt.\n\n“But what for?” I asked.\n\n“Wandering with intent to commit an arrestable offence,” he said.\n\n“What offence?” I asked.\n\n“Theft,” he said.\n\n“Theft of what?” I asked.\n\n“Milk bottles,” he said, and with a perfectly straight face too!\n\n“Oh,” I said.\n\nIt turned out there had been a lot of petty thefts in the area, particularly that of stealing milk bottles from doorsteps.\n\nThen I made my big mistake. At the time I was nineteen, had long untidy hair, and regarded myself as part of the sixties’ youth counterculture. As a result, I wanted to appear cool and unconcerned with the incident, so I said, “How long have you been following me?” in the most casual and conversational tone I could manage. I thus appeared to them to be quite familiar with this sort of situation, and it confirmed in their belief that I was a thoroughly disreputable character.\n\nA few minutes later a police car arrived.\n\n“Get in the back,” they said. “Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don’t move them.”\n\nThey got in on either side of me. It wasn’t funny any more.\n\nAt the police station they questioned me for several hours. I continued to try to look worldly and familiar with the situation. When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I’d been looking for a job. “Aha,” I could see them thinking, “unemployed.”\n\nEventually, I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates’ Court the following Monday. Then they let me go.\n\nI wanted to conduct my own defence in court, but as soon as my father found out what had happened, he hired a very good solicitor. We went along that Monday armed with all kinds of witnesses, including my English teacher from school as a character witness. But he was never called on to give evidence. My ‘trial’ didn’t get that far. The magistrate dismissed the case after fifteen minutes. I was free. The poor police had never stood a chance. The solicitor even succeeded in getting costs awarded against the police."

Cutting carbon dioxide emissions could save millions of lives, mostly by reducing preventable deaths from heart and lung diseases, according to studies released Wednesday and published in a special issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.\n\n\"Relying on fossil fuels leads to unhealthy lifestyles, increasing our chances of getting sick and in some cases takes years from our lives,\" US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telecast briefing from her home state of Kansas. \"As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. This is not a small effect.\"\n\nInstead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n\nSome possible benefits seemed highly speculative, the researchers conceded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung, charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\n\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\n\"Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,\" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\n\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found. But if people also drove less and walked or biked more, those extra saved years would soar to more than 7,300 years in London and 12,500 years in Delhi because of less heart disease."

You may want to share what you eat with your friends or just post part of your daily life onto the Internet. However, such action may be very annoying to other diners, or even to chefs and restaurant owners. Currently, more and more people begin to consider \"foodstagramming\" as very silly and a bad manner.\n\nIn many restaurants, diners complain of being blinded by flasher, snapped without their permission and disturbed by people climbing on to chairs for a better angle. Even chefs and restaurant owners are annoyed at food photography. A Michelin-starred chef said, \"It's hard to build a memorable evening when flashes are flying every six minutes.\"\n\nAt the start of 2013, the debate on whether it is OK to take photographs of your food in restaurants seemed to swing towards a definite \"no.\" According to several chefs in New York City, some restaurants there have started banning customers from taking photos of their food. Policies around the ban of food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant, ranging from restrictions on using a flash to outright bans. If other restaurants follow such policies, it may signal the death of \"foodstagramming\".\n\nNevertheless, instead of banning food photography, some restaurants are offering food photography courses. In Spain, the restaurant group Grupo Gourmet has started running a \"Fotografia para foodies\" course to instruct its customers to better take food pictures. The course teaches customers to take photos in a proper way without disturbing other diners, such as never use a flash."

It began with a small thing, then bitter words, and then weeks of silence. One morning Farmer John woke up to find a stream between the two farms. \"It must be Bob,\" John thought.\n\nThen one day there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a carpenter standing at the doorway.\n\n\"I'm looking for a few days' work,\" the carpenter said.\n\n\"I do have a job for you,\" John said. \"Look across the stream at that farm.

To blame the other guy is even more human.\n\nCommon sense is not all that common.\n\nWhy tell the truth when you can come up with a good excuse?\n\nThese three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes, and yet they tell us a lot about human nature. To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do. The original quote about human nature went like this: \"To err is human, to forgive, divine.\" This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite—find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.\n\nCommon sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm, but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine. Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations, because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, \"the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\"\n\nAnd what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time. There is a corollary to that: if good excuse is \"good\" even if it isn't honest, then where is the place of the truth?"

He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\n\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\n\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\n\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\n\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way, sailor?\" she murmured.\n\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\n\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\n\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment. \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\n\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\n\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are.\""

However, there’s going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you’ll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\n\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn’t try as hard as you could have in school. It’s a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you’re still young and have plenty of time to recover.\n\nI’m definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they’re a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you’re younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\n\nStarting the wrong career\n\nWouldn’t you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It’s a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. See, when you’re 23 and find out you don’t like the career path you’ve chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\n\nWe no longer live in an age where you are expected to stay with one company until you retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn’t as simple.\n\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into from starting at the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20s just doesn’t have to deal with.\n\nDating the wrong person\n\nThe divorce rate in the US is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren’t doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it’s better to find out that the person you’re with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\n\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you’re\n\nMessing up your credit\n\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you’re young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you’re young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\n\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you’ll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\n\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they’re older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\n\nMaking bad investments\n\nIf you’re investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you’ll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it’s a lot better to take risks when you’re younger.\n\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you’re young and the market takes a hit, you’re not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\n\nBlowing your money\n\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\n\nBut if you’re 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it’s not unusual for people in their 20s to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets.\n\nWhen you get older, you’ll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you’re older and waste your money, you’ll REALLY have nothing to show for it."

    "predicted_text": "In recent years many countries of the world have been faced with the problem of how to make their workers more productive. Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied. But do more various jobs lead to greater productivity? There is evidence to suggest that while variety certainly makes the worker's life more enjoyable, it does not actually make him work harder. As far as increasing productivity is concerned, then variety is not an important factor.\n\nOther experts feel that giving the worker freedom to do his job in his own way is important, and there is no doubt that this is true. The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot easily be given in the modern factory with its complicated machinery which must be used in a fixed way. Thus while freedom of choice may be important, there is usually very little that can be done to create it.\n\nAnother very important consideration is how each worker contributes to the product he is making. In most factories the worker sees only one part of the product. Some car factories are now experimenting with having many small production lines rather than one large one, so that each worker contributes more to the production of the cars on his line. It would seem that not only is degree of the worker contribution an important factor, therefore, but it is also one we can do something about.\n\nTo what extent does more money lead to greater productivity? The workers themselves certainly think this is important. But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring. Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more. A similar argument may explain demands for shorter working hours. Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting, they will neither want more money, nor will shorter working hours be so important to them."

Over millions of years, as climates change and mountains rise, new dry and wet areas develop. But within the last 100 years, deserts have been growing at a frightening speed.

Jeannie understands 72 or more different commands. On a shopping trip, she can get money for Lee Ann at the bank or candies at the store. She can pay the cashier and get change back. Jeannie brings things to Lee Ann and puts them in her lap.\n\nJeannie was trained at a place called Canine Companions for Independence, located on twelve acres of land in Santa Rosa (California). The land was donated by the cartoonist Charles Shultz. \"We train four different types of dogs here,\" said Ken Kirsh, a dog trainer there. \"Hearing dogs, service dogs, skilled companion dogs, and facility dogs.\"\n\nTrainers work with Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers for hours a day, but not every dog is good enough to be a working dog.\n\nThe work is a serious business. Hearing dogs warn their owners of sounds like ringing telephones and doorbells. Other dogs work with disabled patients like eight-year-old Noah Habib who communicates with a special computer. He likes it when people come to ask him about his dog. His father says, \"People are really interested in the dog and will come over and ask to pet her and play with her, and ask about what she does, and these are people that normally might not approach us and want to talk to Noah.\"\n\nWhen Lee Ann Laraway comes home with Jeannie and her goods, Jeannie helps her open the door. \"You can train a dog to do a lot of things.\" said Lee Ann."

The old man asked him how he would live among high officials. The student answered, \"I will be all right. I have prepared a hundred high hats, one for each official I will meet. I am sure I will succeed.\" The teacher got angry on hearing this. \"What?\" he cried. \"Is this what ten years of my teaching has made of you? Nothing but flatterer?\" \"Excuse me, honored master,\" the student rose to his feet and apologized hurriedly. \"But you have always been absorbed in your studies and don't know how vulgar the world has come to be. There are few men in the world who are above flatterers like you.\" \"There is something true in what you said,\" the teacher nodded, smiling with one of the student's \"high hats\" on."

    "predicted_text": "Most young people enjoy some forms of physical activities. It may be walking, cycling or swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some kind, football, hockey, golf, or tennis, it may be mountaineering.\n\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountaineering? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\n\nMountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no manmade rules, as there are for such game as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind, which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from manmade rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\n\nIf we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"game\". We would be mistaken in this assumption. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\n\nThe mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical capacities.\n\nA mountain climber continues to improve in skill year after year. A skier is probably past his prime by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties. But it is not unusual for a man of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in the Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they probably climb with more skill and less wasted effort, and they certainly experience enjoyment."

However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.\n\nPeople in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status, intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress differently for business and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also are intended to communicate messages to members of the same gender.\n\nLong before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.\n\nPutting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor’s white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that they can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status. For instance, the strange hairstyle and clothing of the English \"punks\" are essential aspects of their uniforms.\n\nThere are many forms of body decoration other than clothes that are used around the world to send messages. These include body and hair paint, and even body deformation. When doctors put braces on teeth, they are actually doing the same thing – deforming or reforming a part of the body to make it more attractive."

Designed by researchers at Japan's Tsukuba University, the device supports the flex() of the knee, which enables a runner to use 30% less muscle power compared to running unassisted.\n\nComing in a kit, the device consists of a small motor that helps flex the knee, a sensor that detects the knees' degree of flex, and a safety lever --all of which attach to the user's leg. The user is also forced to carry a backpack that holds a control unit and battery to power the motor. All up the device weighs around 5kg, which will probably lessen the performance benefits of wearing the device somewhat. In experiments runners wearing the device could jog at 7.5kmh, which is hardly anything special--but predictably they could do it for longer.\n\nCuriously, the makers of the motorized knee say it isn't designed for the physically handicapped. Rather it is intended for people who want to run in a more efficient way. I can't help thinking this cuts down the potential market considerably. After all, most runners I know do it for the sake of their fitness. Wouldn't a device that is designed to do some of the work mean that someone would have to run for longer to receive the same fitness benefits?\n\nRegardless, the research team expects to commercialize the kit within the next three years, by which time they also plan to have made the device significantly smaller and lighter."

    "predicted_text": "College visits are important. Before you commit years of your life and money to a school, be sure you’re choosing a place that is a good match for your personality and interests. You can’t get the “feel” of a school from any guidebook, so be sure to visit the campus. Below are a few tips for getting the most out of your college visit.\n\n1. Explore on your own  \nOf course you should take the official campus tour, but be sure to allow time to hang around on your own. The trained tour guides will show you a school’s selling points. But the oldest and prettiest buildings don’t give you the entire picture of a college. Try to walk the extra mile and get the complete picture of the campus.\n\n2. Read the Bulletin Boards  \nWhen you visit the student center, academic buildings and residence hall, take a few minutes to read the bulletin boards. They provide an easy way to see what’s happening on campus. The ads for lectures, clubs and plays can tell you what’s going on outside the classrooms.\n\n3. Eat in the Dining Hall  \nYou can get a good feel for student life by eating in the dining hall. Try to sit with students if you can. Do the students seem happy or stressed? Also, is the food good? Are there adequate healthy options? Many admission offices will give prospective students coupons for free meals in the dining halls.\n\n4. Visit a Class in Your Major  \nIf you know what you want to study, a class visit makes a lot of sense. You’ll get to observe other students in your field and see how involved they are in classroom discussion. Try to stay after class for a few minutes and chat with the students to get their impressions of their professors and major. Be sure to call in advance to schedule a classroom visit—most colleges don’t allow visitors to drop in on class unannounced.\n\n5. Talk to Lots of Students  \nYour campus tour guide has been trained to market the school. Try to talk to students who aren’t getting paid to impress you. These important conversations can often provide you with information about college life that isn’t part of the admission script. Few university officials will tell you if their students spend all weekend drinking or studying, but a group of random students might.\n\nFor more tips, please go to collegeapps.about.com."

Then, during the first period, teachers call in orders on their room phones, and students make deliveries. By closing time at 9:20 a.m., the shop usually sells 90 drinks.\n\n\"Whoever made the chi tea, Ms. Schatzman says it was good,\" Christy McKinley, a second year student, announced recently, after hanging up with the teacher.\n\nThe shop is called the Dixie PIT, which stands for Power in Transition. Although some of the students are not disabled, many are, and the PIT helps them prepare for life after high school.\n\nThey learn not only how to run a coffee shop but also how to deal with their affairs. They keep a timecard and receive paychecks, which they keep in check registers.\n\nSpecial-education teachers Kim Chevalier and Sue Casey introduced the Dixie PIT from a similar program at Kennesaw Mountain High School in Georgia.\n\nNot that it was easy. Chevalier's first problem to overcome was product-related. Should schools be selling coffee? What about sugar content?\n\nKenton County Food Service Director Ginger Gray helped. She made sure all the drinks, which use non-fat milk, fell within nutrition guidelines.\n\nThe whole school has joined in to help.\n\nTeachers agreed to give up their 1 ounce in the mornings. Art students painted the name of the shop on the wall. Business students designed the paychecks. The basketball team helped pay for cups."

    "predicted_text": "Individuality is the particular character, or aggregate (total) of qualities that distinguishes one person or thing from others. Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered. The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed.\n\nHer search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.\n\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\n\nHer second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian tunics, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\n\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.\n\nShe was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance."

It ran into an oncoming vehicle, leaving the occupants trapped inside as both vehicles burst into flames.\n\nBonge was the first on the scene and heard children screaming. He broke through a back window and pulled Mallory Smith, 10, and her sister, Megan Smith, 9, from the wreckage.\n\nThe girls' mother, Beckie Smith, was not with them at the time of the wreck, as they were traveling with their baby sitter, Lisa Bowbin.\n\nBeckie Smith still remembers the sickening feeling she had upon receiving the call informing her of the wreck and the despair as she drove to the scene.\n\nBozeman and Clemmons arrived shortly after Bonge and helped rescue the other victims and attempted to put out the fires.\n\n\"I was nervous,\" Bozeman said. \"I don't feel like I'm a hero. I was just doing what anyone should do in that situation. I hope someone would do the same for me.\"\n\nEveryone at the accident made it out alive, with the victims suffering from nonlife-threatening injuries. Mallory Smith broke both femurs, and Megan had neck and back injuries. Bowbin is still recovering from a broken pelvis, ankle and foot.\n\nThe rescuers also were taken to the hospital and treated for cuts and smoke breathing, Bonge said.\n\nIn addition, Bozeman got to meet accident victim Anthony Russo in the hospital after the accident, where Russo presented him with a glass frame inscribed with \"Thank you,\" Bozeman said. Those involved in that fateful encounter on Highway 6 credited God blessing for bringing them together.\n\n\"Whatever the circumstances, Tuesday's ceremony provided a time to be grateful for those who put their lives on the line for the lives of complete strangers,\" Beckie Smith said, \"We're calling it The Miracle on Highway 6.\""

With proper planning, though, it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.\n\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness:\n\nDon't skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack. This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.\n\nControl the amount of food. Use a small plate that may encourage you to \"load up.\" You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist.\n\nBegin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables, or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full.\n\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amounts of fat. Choose lean meat. Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of creamy food.\n\nStick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk helps to burn off extra calories. (238 words)"

About 59% of engineering companies in the IET’s 2014 survey feared skill shortages could threaten business. “There is nothing as creative as engineering,” Sir John told the reporter. He says science, technology, engineering and mathematics - often known as “Stem” subjects, are vital for a modern knowledge economy. But there is a massive shortfall in the number of recruits - with a recent study by the Royal Academy of Engineering saying the UK needs to increase by as much as 50% the number of Stem graduates it produces.\n\nDelivering this year’s Mountbatten Lecture at the Royal Institution, Sir John argued that engineers should recognise the role of the arts in their work - among other benefits; this could attract more people into the profession. The lecture, Full Steam Ahead for Growth, advocated a wider adoption -- Steam, or science, technology, engineering, arts and maths. Engineers should embrace the arts as being key to creativity and an important component of innovation, crucial to creating new products and boosting future competitiveness, he argued. “Engineering and technology is an increasingly diverse and creative field,” said Sir John.\n\nSome university engineering departments already cooperated with art schools to develop understanding, he told the reporter. In particular he mentioned Cranfield University’s Centre for Creative Competitive Design and Imperial College’s work with the Royal College of Art. The two sets of people could work well together and more emphasis on the creative side of engineering could improve the success of products, he said.\n\n“Aesthetics is part of it,” he told the reporter, adding that Apple’s iPod was not the first digital media player, nor the only one that worked - but it came to dominate the market “because it was nice to have”.\n\nSir John said he was not suggesting universities started requiring A-level art from engineering applicants - the key subjects for admission would continue to be maths and the sciences. But an emphasis on creative skills would help “broaden the pool and attract more people in”."

There was still time. She'd hurry with the papers and finish the math before breakfast.\n\nLess than an hour later, Jane was nearly finished. She had only five customers to go.

Frigo's is not a tiny place. It provides different kinds of Italian food. There are refrigerator cases full of prepared foods and desserts, and shelves filled with olives and various pasta. There's some traditional Italian music and the smell is of olive oil and garlic. Above the largest refrigerator case, there's a chalk board covered with descriptions of more Italian sandwiches than I could remember. I stepped into Frigo's almost by accident when I had to stay in Springfield into the evening for an open house at the school where I work. Frigo's is the perfect place to find something quick to go. There are no tables, so all food is taken out. I also thought it would be a great place to pick up some already-prepared food to bring home for dinner. I ordered the easiest meal possible: a chicken sandwich and a salad. It cost $4.75 for the sandwich. The salad was $4.99 and didn't have salad dressing on it. I must have missed the choice of salad dressing on the way out. The sandwich was great—great chicken, excellent tomato sauce and not too much cheese. I wish I had tried one of the many other sandwiches which include Joe's Favorite ($5.25-$6.75) and the Dante (King) which is made of turkey breast, roasted red peppers, asiago cheese and choice of dressing. I have a feeling that I'll be picking up dinner for me and the kids at Frigo's soon."
