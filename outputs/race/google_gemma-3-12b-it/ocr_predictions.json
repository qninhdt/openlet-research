When we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something warm to drink; however, it was not this that I remember, and that she had just had some pups. She was hungry and weak and I felt bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her pups would not live. People walking by didn't even notice her. She was not as pretty and clean as most dogs, but she still deserved better. We still did not do anything, but someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went into the store and bought dog food with all the money he had."

A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire. Sometimes, though, a fire can start on its own. Wet hay can begin burning by itself. This is how it happens: the hay starts to rot and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it. Finally, it bursts into flames. That’s why farmers cut and store their hay when it’s dry.\n\nFires have destroyed whole cities. In the 17th century, a small fire which began in a baker’s shop burnt down nearly every building in London. Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon. This fire continued burning for seven days. And, of course, in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome. Even today, in spite of modern fire-fighting methods, fire causes millions of pounds’ worth of damage each year both in our cities and in the countryside.

The user is also forced to carry a backpack that holds a control unit and battery to power the motor. All up the device weighs around 5kg, which will probably lessen the performance benefits of wearing the device somewhat. In experiments runners wearing the device could jog at 7.5kmh, which is hardly anything special –but predictably they could do it for longer.\n\nCuriously, the makers of the motorized knee say it isn’t designed for the physically handicapped. Rather it is intended for people who want to run in a more efficient way. I can’t help thinking this cuts down the potential market considerably. After all, most runners I know do it for the sake of their fitness.

With proper planning, though, it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don’t have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.\n\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness.\n\nDon’t skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack. This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.\n\nControl the amount of food. Use a small plate that may encourage you to “load up.” You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist.\n\nBegin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables, or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full.\n\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat. Choose lean meat. Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of creamy food.\n\nStick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk helps to burn off extra calories."

The doctors said there was little chance of my coming out of it, but my identical twin, Marcus, didn't believe them and carried on talking to my first words when I came to myself were, \"Hello, Marcus.\" Even though I had no memory of my own name, or that the woman crying at my bedside was my mother, I knew Marcus immediately; it was like a genetic memory, just felt as weeks went by, I still could remember nothing before the accident. Marcus was the only person I could relate to.\n\nI had to relearn everything, and Marcus helped me. Because of my twin I scared of having lost my memory; I believed everything he said. He became my memory, telling me about my school, friends, previous girlfriends and holidays, showing me family photographs, and telling me how perfect I was.\n\nWith his encouragement I slowly recovered and tried to become the person everyone around me loved. Then years later, when my memories flooded back, I learned that I was anything but perfect—I was troublesome, selfish, and now very angry with Marcus for having lied to me. \n\nBut finally I understood. Out of love, Marcus had chosen not to tell me about my dark side. He wanted me to have a fresh start—and in fact I had one. Thanks to him, I was able to get married and have kids. I’m 46 now, and feel as if I’m in the third stage of my life. I know all there is to know, and wouldn’t want it any other way."

During their visit, the conversation turned to complaints about stress in their work and lives.\n\nOffering his guests hot chocolate, the professor went into the kitchen and – telling them to help themselves to the hot chocolate. \n\nWhen they all had a cup of hot chocolate in hand, the professor said: “I notice that all the nice looking and expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. The cup that you’re drinking from adds nothing to the quality of the hot chocolate. In most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink. What all of you really wanted was hot chocolate, not the cup; but you consciously went for the best cups… And then you began eyeing each others cups. Now consider this: Life is the hot chocolate; your job, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life. The cup you have does not define, nor change the quality of life you have. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the hot chocolate we have. The happiest people don’t have the best of everything. They just make the best of everything that they have. Live simply. Love generously. Care deeply. Speak kindly. Thank the Lord for your blessings in 2011. And enjoy your hot chocolate in 2012!”"

In fact, the difference in spelling was created by Noah Webster (1758–1843). He is a teacher who reformed English to make American identity stronger. Linguists celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16,2008. After the Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary, rather than rely on British versions. He dropped the British \"u\" in some words and he changed “centre” into “center” for children to learn English by spelling words more like they sounded.\n\nWebster wasn’t shy about expressing his opinions. In defining \"preposterous (unreasonable),\" he wrote: “A Republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.”\n\nWebster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom.\n\n“He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,” said Joshua Kendall, who is working on a biography about Webster. “He at least got us united through our language."

This is not a small effect.\"\n\nInstead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n\nSome possible benefits seemed highly speculative, researchers concluded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stove that burn dung, charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\n\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\n“Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,” said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\n\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found. But if people also drove less and walked or biked more, those extra saved years would soar to more than 7,300 years in London and 12,500 years in Delhi because of less heart disease."

Some want technical improvements such as quieter air conditioners or better sound barriers around roads. Others want tougher laws to restrict noise from building sites or to require owners to take responsibility for barking dogs. The highest priority was a noise complaints system that works.\n\nBrisbane City Council receives more complaints about noise than all other problems put together. So it conducted a survey and found that half its residents are upset by noise in one form or another – traffic, mowers, pool pumps, air conditioners or loud parties. This inspired the Council to bring together more than 100 citizens one evening to talk through a range of options.\n\nThe meeting found the present regulatory system complainants often feel they are getting the run-round. When the people at the forum were asked to vote for changes, the strongest response was for a 24-hour noise hotline to be the first step.\n\nBut there are obvious conflicts. Many people like to have a bar want a noisy pub keeping them awake when they want an early night. Most people want to live near a major road providing good access to other parts of the city, but they don't want the problem of road noise.\n\nI was most interested by the proposals aimed at behavioral change. There was strong support for measures to reduce traffic: better public transport, cycle ways and footpaths, even charges for road use. Many people optimistically thought industry awards for better equipment would stimulate the production of quieter appliances. It was even suggested that noise from building sites could be alleviated if Brisbane adopted daylight saving, thus shifting the working day and providing longer, quieter evenings."

She told us, “Daniel is so full of curiosity.” At that moment, we hear a loud noise and then silence. We go upstairs and find Daniel getting out of a wardrobe which he has pulled over onto the floor, with a book in his hand. “It’s for you, Mum,” he says and looks up at his mum and smiles. Seven-year-old Daniel has a lovely face. He has golden hair, big brown eyes, and a friendly smile. I have to admit that Daniel doesn’t look like a naughty boy.\n\nAngela told me all about it, “Once I found him as he was about to put Jasper in the washing machine.” Jasper, she explained, is the Browns' dog. “When I asked him why, he said that he thought Jasper was dirty! It’s amazing how one little boy can cause so much trouble. Another time he cut off all the hair of the little girl next door. She was going to attend her sister’s wedding and the neighbors haven’t spoken to us since.”\n\nAngela told me about Daniel’s most expensive crime. “I was about to do the washing up when the baby started crying. Daniel decided to help and filled the kitchen sink with water. When I came in, the water was already flooding the kitchen and was about to flood the hall. The carpet was ruined and had to be replaced. I hope things will get better as he gets older.”\n\nAmazingly, Daniel is quite well behaved at school. This may be because he is seldom bored.

However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.\n\nPeople in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status, intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress clothing to communicate messages and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also communicate messages to members of the same gender.\n\nLong before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.\n\nPutting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor's white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that messages can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status. For instance, the strange hairstyle and clothing of the English “punks” are essential aspects of their uniforms.\n\nThere are many forms of body decoration other than clothes that are used around the world to send messages. These include body and hair paint, and even body deformation. When doctors put braces on teeth, they are actually doing the same thing – deforming or reforming a part of the body to make it more attractive."

Here’s what you need to know to avoid tragedy:\n\nDrowning: Each year, thousands of children die from drowning, with two-thirds of accidents occurring in the summer. To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another somewhat individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n\nFalls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision.\n\nBikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\n\nPedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need to models and teach proper pedestrian behavior. Cross at the corner and when you do cross, continue to look both ways because there are likely to be more cars turning into your path or people speeding. Obey all the traffic signals."

Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\n\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated.

They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way.\n\nWhat makes a relationship healthy?\n\nCommunication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don’t lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n\nRespect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Arguing calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.\n\nHow do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?\n\nYou know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.\n\nHealthier peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than he or she gives to you.\n\nYou should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets. In a healthy relationship, you like to spend time with the other person, instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her."

After twenty minutes he left, silently. Visions of unemployment marched before my eyes.\n\nI felt mildly victorious that I got through the rest of class without crying, but at my next free period I had to face him.

Chocolate drink was first made from the seeds of the cacao tree by South American Indians. The Spanish introduced it to the rest of the world during the 1500s. And although it was very expensive, it quickly became popular. In London, shops where chocolate drinks were served became important places. Some still exist today. The potato is also from Peru to Europe, where it soon was widely grown. Ireland became so dependent on it that thousands of Irish people starved when the crop failed during the years of 1845—1846, and thousands Brazil is now the world’s largest grower of coffee, and coffee is an important crop in other South American countries. But it is native to Ethiopia. It was first made into a drink by Arabs during the 1400s. According to an Arabic Story, coffee was discovered when a goat keeper named Lakdi noticed that his goats were eating red fruits on a coffee tree. He tried one and experienced the “wide-awake” feeling that one third of the world’s population now starts the day with."

He put clues in the story to help readers find it. Thousands of people hunted for the treasure. They dug holes all over Britain, hoping to find it.\n\nOne of the most popular adventure stories ever written is Robert Louis Stephenson's \"Treasure Island\", an exciting story about a young boy, Jim Hawkins, who is captured by pirates and later finds some buried treasure.\n\nAlthough it is true that people sometimes lose their money because a bank fails, banks are still the safest place to keep our savings and treasures.\n\nAnd then there was the man who buried his savings, all in bank notes, in a waterproof bag. When he dug it up years later, there was nothing left. Worms and insects had eaten the bag and everything in it.\n\nAnd of course, these are stories about people who bury things and either forget where they have buried them or lose the map."

So far most of the smoking deaths have happened to men, especially in developing countries.\n\nA researcher at the World Health Organization says 70% of Chinese men smoke more than 15 cigarettes each day. In Latin America about 50% of the men are smokers. There also are a very large number of smokers in Russia and in Eastern Europe. And 25% of all smoking deaths worldwide are in those areas of the world. Scientists say smoking will kill 50% of the smokers.\n\nSmoking is known to cause lung cancer. It also can lead to cancer of the mouth and other parts of bodies. Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to suffer from heart disease.\n\nExperts say that people reduce their chance of dying from smoking if they stop smoking completely. They say smokers who give up smoking can improve their health."

Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenager honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11, He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, dealing nothing work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres’s wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed almost ready to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres’s good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres not hurt. The dog was killed.\n\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said at a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you think it, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\n\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 99th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2 line to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\n\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can’t see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that would use most of his mind and hand to disable the long trip, as well. \"I don’t understand there is what people can do instead of about anything except drive buses,\" he said. It was the first time he had spoken to the Bronx hospital’s head of transcription rather than but cut do, the hospital spokesperson.\n\nOne day as he was going to work, Mr. Torres said, “I felt like I had to deal with this day, too.” He was 20 years old, unusually employed for 19 years. He had to sit, to be sure as to his physicians desire. He also knew that his wife’s future was not likely to last much longer, and that his daughter would soon be away at college. “I’ve been through worse,” he said. “I just don’t want to get too moping about it.” He did not, in fact, mope. He gets up every morning, makes his coffee, feeds the dog, and heads for the subway."

It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here’s the true answer:\n\nThe most important thing I’ve ever done occurred on October 8, 1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn’t seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other’s lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\n\nWhile we were playing, a car came screeching up the road toward the courts. It was my friend’s father, who shouted to friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\n\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed. Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there. I convinced myself that I do just that—just be there when someone needed me.\n\nHere. The most important thing I’ve done almost didn’t happen because of something I had learned in classroom and then rejected throughout my whole career. I had learned lawyers shouldn’t get involved. Law schools or in six years of legal practice were any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that—just be there when someone needed me.\n\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families when they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said, \"Thanks for being here.\"\n\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\n\nIt’s the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\n\nFirst: The most important thing I’ve ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that—just be there when someone needed me.\n\nMy friend and his wife supported well, maybe they’ll be surrounded by more hugs and smiles, and, kinder but more comforting and support, whether it’s the father, brother or a friend. There are people who are there for you. There are people who care. And sometimes, you can’t do anything else but be there.\n\nAnd second, the most important thing I’ve ever done happened because I ignored what I had been taught. I rejected the lessons I had learned in law school and in my first six years of practice. Because for a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of how moments were to mean an instant in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son."

But can medicine come packaged in chicken eggs?\n\nA team of scientists from Scotland say \"yes.\" They've engineered special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These eggs come from chickens that have been engineered to produce certain drugs inside their egg whites.\n\nThese drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals—thousands of proteins—they’re the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they’re good candidates for making protein drugs.\n\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens’ DNA – so that the birds’ cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs’ possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs."

The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. \n\nPaul Neuman’s camp counselors (1) were trying to fill David’s days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer, recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session sat quiet, sad little pirate.\n\nThen something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that would call \"huge”. \n\nIt was cabin night. That’s the time when campers and counselors spend time together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\n\nSlowly David walked over to the table, leaving his corner to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief. I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\n\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on the table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\n\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released.\n\nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little miner boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible. Several days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t try to fit in his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. I said it’s only a doorway. You walk through door and there’s the Lord to be with you, Hey Athena, a soul like people waiting to hug you.\n\nAfter Mass, he said to me, “Hey Father, a door, huh?”\n\nA couple more days of fun passed and another full talent show. It was the most colorful and spirited talent show we’d ever had.\n\nWe were deep into our final campfire program when David looked at me with a light in his eyes and said, “Father, I want to be baptized.”\n\nI didn’t hesitate. \n\nWe went down to the lake and I baptized him. It was a beautiful ceremony. \n\nWe were all a little misty-eyed. \n\nNobody knew he would be gone in two weeks.\n\nDavid had a rare type of cancer. He went home immediately after camp and died shortly thereafter."

At Jackson’s trial, although two witnesses testified that Jackson was with them, the jury sometimes sees photographs of other races. Furthermore, the court eventually freed Jackson after the police found the real criminal.\n\nMany factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them. Many people believe that police officers are more reliable than ordinary people. Psychologists decided to test this idea, and they discovered that it is not true. Two psychologists showed a film this idea, and both police officers and civilians in correctly remembering the details of the crimes. \n\nDespite all the possibilities for inaccuracy, courts cannot omit eyewitness testimony from a trial. American courts depend almost completely on eyewitness testimony to resolve court cases. It is the only evidence to a crime, such as rapes. Although people sometimes make mistakes, and convict innocent people, more importantly, eyewitness testimony has rightly convicted a larger number of guilty people.\n\nAmerican courts depend on the ability of the twelve jurors, and not the judges, to determine the accuracy of the witness's testimony. It is their responsibility to decide if a certain witness could actually see, hear and remember what happened."

He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\n\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner’s name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address.\n\nDuring the next year and one month, they grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn’t matter what she looked like.\n\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting--7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. “You’ll recognize me,” she wrote, “by the red rose I’ll be wearing on my lapel.” So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he’d never seen.\n\nI’ll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. “Going my way, sailor?” she murmured.\n\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind her. A woman past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\n\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small blue leather copy of the book that I would not put down.\n\nThis would not be the first time that I had made a mistake, but it would be the first time that I had done so deliberately. I sailed through the years with her, traveling the world, sharing her joys, comforting her sorrows. She became my wife, and I worshipped her. We had two children, a boy and a girl. Both of them inherited their mother’s eyes and hair.\n\nI loved her not for her beauty, but for her kindness and her tolerance. She was a wonderful mother and a devoted wife. She was a woman who had seen much of the world and learned much from it. She was a woman who had lived a full and happy life.\n\nAnd then, one day, she was gone. I never saw her again after that night at the station. I often wonder if she ever thought of me. I hope she did. I hope she knew how much I loved her. I hope she knew that I would never forget her."

Or they might use a computer to help them in their search for a soul mate by joining an online dating service. Some people have even tried to find their perfect match through game shows on television. Many of these TV dating shows, including The Bachelor and Who Wants to Marry Multimillionaire?, have proved to be popular, with millions of viewers watching each week to find out which of the contestants will find true love.\n\nOf all these game shows, perhaps the one with the most unexpected ending was Mr. Right, which was shown in England in 2002. On the show, a bachelor, a five-year-old Lance Gerrard-Wright, dated fifteen women to find the one who was his ideal partner. The host of the show was Ulrika Jonsson, an English celebrity originally from Sweden. For seven weeks on the show, Lance took turns going on dates with each of the women, taking them to expensive restaurants and romantic locations. He even met the women's families and introduced them to his own. Then at the end of each episode, he would choose between one and three of the contestants with whom he had felt the least compatible, and say goodbye to them.\n\nAt one point during the series, one contestant volunteered to leave because she said she didn't find him attractive. After two dates she said she had had enough, and she couldn't see it \"working. He wasn't my cup of tea.\" In another episode the woman he was on a date with burst into tears when he called her by another girl's name. \"You called me by another girl's name. I can't believe you did that. I really liked you,\" she said in tears.\n\nBut in the final episode, the woman he eventually chose decided she didn't want to marry him after all. \"I think you've chosen me because you have to choose someone,\" she said. Maybe this was because she already knew he had fallen in love with the show's host!\n\nAfter leaving the show, Gerrard-Wright and Jonsson were seen dining together and attending parties around London more and more often. Finally, on May 1, 2003, Gerrard-Wright proposed to Jonsson on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. And she accepted his proposal right away, although she had to make sure that her two children from previous relationships—an eight-year-old son, Cameron, and a two-year-old daughter, Bo, agreed to the marriage. Luckily, they did. Gerrard-Wright said, \"In the end the show did work for me. I grabbed an opportunity to get a girlfriend and I did. Ulrika's amazing.\"\n\nThe happy couple initially planned to marry in 2004, but Jonsson said she didn't want to marry until her children felt comfortable with the idea. \"I don't want to rush things,\" she explained in an interview. “I want to make sure everyone is happy and ready.\" But then, in September 2003, Jonsson announced that she and Gerrard-Wright had split up. \"We have decided to go our separate ways,\" she said in a statement. \"We've both been through a lot recently and we need to focus on ourselves.\""

Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied. But do more various jobs lead to greater productivity? There is evidence to suggest that while variety certainly makes the worker's life more enjoyable, it does not actually make him work harder. As far as increasing productivity is concerned, then variety is not an important factor.\n\nOther experts feel that giving the worker freedom to do his job in his own way is important, and there is no doubt that this is true. The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot easily be given in the modern factory with its complicated machinery which must be experimenting with having many small production lines rather than one large one, so that each worker contributes more to the production of the cars on his line. It would seem that not only is degree of the worker contribution an important factor, therefore, but it is also one we can do something about.\n\nTo what extent does more money lead to greater productivity? The workers themselves certainly think this is important. But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring. Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more. A similar argument may explain demands for shorter working hours. Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting, they will neither want more money, nor will shorter working hours be so important to them."

Judo uses a number of \"falls\", \"holds\" and \"throws\". Someone who does not know judo cannot defend himself against them. If you know judo you can defend yourself against a person who is stronger than you. You had better not practice judo on your friends unless they can fall without hurting themselves! Being strong is one thing, but using the body wisely is another. In judo, you use the other person's body to help you. You \"throw\" him to the ground and \"hold\" him there, so that he cannot move. Of course, it takes time and practice, but knowing judo is useful. In a violent world you ought to be able to defend yourself."

You may want to share what you eat with your friends or just post part of your daily life onto the Internet. However, such action may be very annoying to other diners, or even to chefs and restaurant owners. Currently, more and more people begin to consider \"foodstagramming\" as very silly and a bad manner.\n\nIn many restaurants, diners complain of being blinded by flasher, snapped without their permission and disturbed by people climbing on to chairs for a better angle. Even chefs are annoyed at food photography. A Michelin-starred chef said, \"It's hard to build a memorable evening when flashes are flying every six minutes.\"\n\nAt the start of 2013, the debate on whether it is OK to take photographs of your food in restaurants seemed to swing towards a definite \"no.\" According to several chefs in New York City, some restaurants there have started banning customers from taking photos of their food. Policies around the ban of food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant, ranging from restrictions on using a flash to outright bans. If other restaurants follow such policies, it may signal the death of \"foodstagramming.\"\n\nNevertheless, instead of banning food photography, some restaurants are offering food photography courses. In Spain, the restaurant group Grupo Gourmet has started running a \"Fotografía para foodies\" course to instruct its customers to better take food pictures. The course teaches customers to take photos in a proper way without disturbing other diners, such as never use a flash."

These three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes, and yet they tell us a lot about human nature. To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do - the original quote about human nature went like this: \"To err is human, to forgive divine.\" This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite - find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.\n\nCommon sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a forecast for sunshine. Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, “the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.”\n\nAnd what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it’s okay not to be totally honest all the time. There is a corollary to that: if a good excuse is \"good\" even if it's not honest, then where is the place of the truth?"

About half of these disabilities are “developmental.” i.e. they occur before the individuals twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered “adventitious,” i.e. accidental or caused by outside forces.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\n\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements [of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\n\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level.\n\nSignificant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society. For example, while no longer prohibited by law from marrying, a person with no access to transportation is effectively excluded from community and social activities which might lead to the development of long-term relationships.\n\nOnly when public attitudes advance as far as laws have will disabled people be fully able to take their rightful place in society."

It may be a game of some kind, football, hockey, golf, or tennis, it may be mountaineering.\n\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountaineering? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\n\nMountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no manmade rules, as there are for such game as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind, which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from manmade rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\n\nIf we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"game\". We would be mistaken in this assumption. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between “teams” of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\n\nThe mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical capacities.\n\nA mountain climber continues to improve in skill year after year. A skier is probably past his prime by the age of thirty, and most international ski champions are in their early twenties. But it is not unusual for a man of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in the Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they probably climb with more skill and less wasted effort, and they certainly experience enjoyment."

But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel, its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch “failure” and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n\nNear the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Fernandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused— Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\n\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe—said one critic—\"forged a story, and forced it on the world for truth.” The detail of Crusoe’s battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author’s imagination for reality. Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe’s time."

But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas turkey or hot chocolates, but some bacteria in your guts.\n\nChinese scientists recently discovered a type of bacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity. \n\nA research team led by Zhao Liping, in Shanghai, has identified a precise link between a particular kind of bacteria and unusual weight gain. \n\n\"The endotoxin released by the bacterium can activate a gene that helps produce fat. And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat,\" Zhao says.\n\nScientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut, microbiota, may play a very important role in the gut microbiota in mice. In 2004, American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice.\n\nWhile a link was believed to exist, proving it was another matter.\n\n\"The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing,\" says Lita Proctor, director of the US National Institutes of Health. \"But the problem is that we’re only able to look at associations and aren’t yet able to conduct cause-and-effect studies.”\n\nIn the clinical study, researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin-producing bacteria, leading to 35 percent of the gut bacteria in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg. \n\nBased on this information, researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a nutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts. \n\nAfter 23 weeks, the patient lost 51.4 kg, with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared."

Many artists late in the ways in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the were in search of a means to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered. The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed.\n\nHer search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.\n\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\n\nHer second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian tunics, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\n\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.\n\nShe was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance."

This was expressed by the equation E = mc2. But bombs were not what Einstein had in mind when he published this equation.\n\nIn 1929, he publicly declared that if a war broke out he \"would refuse to do war service, direct or indirect...\" His position would change in 1933, as the result of Adolf Hitler’s coming into power in Germany.\n\nEinstein's greatest role in the invention of the atomic bomb was signing a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging that the bomb be built because some physicists feared that Germany might be working on an atomic bomb. Among those concerned were physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner. But they had no influence with those in power. So in July 1939 they explained the problem to someone who did: Albert Einstein. After talking with Einstein, in August 1939 Szilard wrote a letter to President Roosevelt with Einstein’s signature on it, which was delivered to Roosevelt in October 1939.\n\nGermany had invaded Poland the previous month, the time was ripe for action. That October research of a-bomb began but proceeded slowly because the invention of the atomic bomb seemed distant and unlikely. In April 1940 an Einstein letter, ghost-written by Szilard, pressed the researchers on the need for \"greater speed\".\n\nAs the realization of nuclear weapons grew near, Einstein looked beyond the current war to future problems that such weapons could bring. He wrote to his friend about his fear about the future use of the a-bomb.\n\nThe atomic bombings of Japan occurred three months after Germany gave in.\n\nIn November 1954, five months before his death, Einstein summarized his feelings about his role in the creation of the atomic bomb: \"I made one great mistake in my life…when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them.”"

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition and heat-related health problems.\n\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\n\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.\n\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum’s report was a \"methodological embarrassment\" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable regions. Dr. Pielke said that \"climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.\" But the report, he said, \"will harm the cause for action on climate change and disasters It is so deeply flawed.\"\n\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.\n\nIn a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gasses. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report."

    "extracted_text": "Long after the 1998 World Cup was won, disappointed fans were still cursing the disputed refereeing decisions that denied victory to their team. A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees.\n\nThe researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams. Each match lasted an hour, divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge.\n\nObservers noted down the referees’ errors, of which there were 61 over the tournament. Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes, each referee made almost 23 mistakes, a remarkably high number.\n\nThe researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail. Surprisingly, he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close away from the action. When the officials got it right, they were, on average, 17 meters from the action; the average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters.\n\nThe research shows the optimum distance is about 20 meters.\n\nThere also seemed to be an optimum speed. Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of 2 meters per second. The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second.\n\nIf FIFA, football’s international ruling body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup, it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance, rather than rushing to keep up with the ball, the researcher argues.\n\nHe also says that FIFA’s insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided. If keeping up with the action is not so important, their physical condition is less critical."

    "extracted_text": "I have only once been in trouble with the process of being arrested and court has never a rather unpleasant experience of the time, but it makes a good story. What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both my subsequent fate in \n\nIt happened in February of twelve years ago. I had still school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October I was living at the time. \n\nOne morning I was in Richmond, a suburb of London near where I lived when I was looking for a temporary job that I could save up some money to go travelling. As it was a fine day and I was in my time, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me. I must have been oblivious that my lot did it.\n\nIt was about half-past eleven when it happened, I was just walking out of the local library, unsuccessfully sought employment elsewhere, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me, I thought he was going to ask me the time. Instead, he said to me a police officer and he was arresting me as I thought it was some kind of joke. \n\nBut then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform and left no doubt. \n\n\"What offense?\" I asked. \n\n\"That,\" he said. \n\n\"What offense?\" I asked. \n\n\"Milk bottles,\" he said, with a perfectly straight face too! \n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \n\nIt turned out two men had been a lot of thefts in the area, particularly that of stealing milk bottles from doorsteps. \n\nThen I made my big mistake. At the time mistaken, had only been aware that they regretted myself as put by the soldiers’ “youth constructionalsorbs” As a result, I was thoroughly unprepared cool and unconcerned with the incident, so I said, “How long have you been bending milk?” in the most casual and conversational tone possible. I thought I was there to equip with this sort of situation, and it confirmed them in their belief that I was a thoroughly disagreeable character.\n\nA few minutes later a police car arrived. \n\n\"Get in the back,\" they said. \"Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don’t move them.\" \n\nThey got me in either side do me. It wasn’t funny any more. \n\nAt the police station they questioned me for several hours. I continued to try to look worldly and familiar with the situation. When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I’d been looking for a job. Aha! I couldn't see them thinking. \"Unemployed.\" \n\nEventually, I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates' Court the following Monday morning. \n\nI was worried enough to consult my uncle, a lawyer, about the seriousness of the charge but he had helped us out in the past. He said that along with the Monday arrival of witnesses, including her tutor from school as a character witness. But he was never all-in on the idea. \n\nHe suggested I try to get in touch with a friend, a barrister, to see if he could get the case thrown out. But I didn’t know any barristers. There was only my dad."

    "extracted_text": "Being young is great. Most of the parts of your body energetic, work great, you have a full head of hair, you’re still, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there’s going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you’ll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\n\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you’ll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\n\nI’d definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they’re a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you’re younger so that you can learn from them and not have ruin your entire life.\n\nStarting the wrong career. Wouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It’s a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you’re 23 and find out you don’t like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\n\nWe no longer live in an age where you're as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. There are plenty of opportunities to try different things. So, stay with one company until retirement? No. You can get bored and it’s fairly easy to switch gears when you’re younger.\n\nGetting divorced. You’re going to get divorced and it’s going to kill you. It's a financial bloodbath. If you’re going to get divorced, do it when you’re young.\n\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it, you have 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcies. \n\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\n\nMaking bad investments. If you’re investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you’ll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it’s a lot better to take risks when you’re younger.\n\nIf you invest in the stock or even real estate you’re young and market takes a hit, you’ll reunite. It is a long-term venture so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\n\nDon't be afraid to fail. When you're young, you have a lot of time to recover. You can always pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try again. The older you get, the less time you have.\n\nSo, here's my advice to you: Be young, take risks, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. It’s a lot better to make them when you’re young and have plenty of time to recover."

    "extracted_text": "College visits are important. Before you commit years of your life and a few to a school, be sure you’re choosing, “that is a good match for your personality and interests. You can’t get the ‘feel’ of a school from any guidebook, so be sure to visit the campus. Below are a few tips for getting the most out of your college visit.\n\nExplore on your own. \n\nOf course you should take the official campus tour, but be sure to allow time to hang around on your own. The trained tour guides will show you a school’s selling points. But the ideal and prettiest buildings don’t give you the entire picture of a college. Try to walk the extra mile and get the complete picture of the campus.\n\nRead the Bulletin Boards.\n\nWhen you visit the student center, academic buildings and residence hall, take a few minutes to read the bulletin boards. They provide an easy way to see what’s happening on campus. The ads for lectures, clubs and days and tell you what’s going on outside the classrooms.\n\nEat in the Dining Hall.\n\nYou can get a good feel for student life by eating in the dining hall. Try to sit with students if you can. Do the students seem happy? Also, is the food good? Are there adequate healthy options? Many admissions offices will give prospective students coupons for free meals in the dining halls.\n\nVisit a Class in Your Major.\n\nIf you know what you want to study, a class visit makes a lot of sense. You’ll get to observe other students in your field and see how involved they are with classroom discussion. Try to stay after class for a few minutes and chat with the students to get their impressions of their professors and major. Be sure to call in advance to schedule a classroom visit—most colleges don’t allow visitors to drop in on class unannounced.\n\nTalk to Lots of Students.\n\nYour campus tour guide has been trained to market the school. Try to talk to students who aren’t getting paid to impress you. These important conversations can often provide with information about college life that isn’t part of the admission service. Few university officials will tell if their students spend all weekend working or studying, but a group of random (,) students might.\n\nFor more tip, go to collegeapps.com."

Several operations and speech classes later, when she was seven, we found out that Jenny had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n\nShe could not put pressure on her feet, so she walked on tiptoe, and when the pain became unbearable, I carried her. Jenny was fortunate, though, because she did not suffer the deformities, often associated with JRA.\n\nAll through grade school, and on into high school, Jenny suffered, yet never complained. She took her medicine, and I would often wrap her feet in steaming towels, and hold her until the pain eased. But, as soon as she could stand, she ran, immediately, carried on, as though she were pain-free.\n\nShe wore a smile on her face, a song on her lips, and a love and acceptance of others. That was simply amazing. She ran when she could run. She played when she could play, and she danced when she could dance. And, when she could run, she ran when she could run.\n\nJenny, a beautiful girl with warm brown eyes, was never a cheerleader. She never competed in a sport. She joined the Band. She won a place in the Governor’s School for the Arts; yet, no one in the Charleston School System knew what to do with Jenny. The perimeters were simple, not in a place with a student, who was both active and disabled. Jenny continued to have one operation after another on her ears, all through school. Her hearing improved to 60%, and she taught herself to read lips.\n\nAt school, she was popular, attending every football game to cheer the team on. She carried her pillow everywhere she activities, especially sports. So she began to bombard the school football coach. Finally the coach gave in, with the warning, “If you miss ONE game, you’re out!” Sonny became Manager of Garrett High School Football Team.\n\nShe carried buckets of water to be one of the best years for Garrett High School football Team in its history. She inspiring talks and it turned out to be one of the best years for Garrett High School Football Team in its history. When asked why she thought that the team was winning all their games, one team member Jack explained, \"Well, when you’ve been knocked down, and you can’t seem to move, you look up and see Jenny Lewis, walking across the field, dragging her buckets and carrying her pillow. It makes you think the rest of us may feel pretty unimportant.”\n\nAt the Senior Awards ceremony, she received a plaque for “Jenny Lewis, Outstanding Student.” Jenny didn't like the attention, she would have preferred to be plain. Jenny just wanted to be accepted to a field trip to Boston with Janet’s disabled history project."
