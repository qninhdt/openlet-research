How can this happen?\n\nWe have already seen that people allow all sorts of waste products to flow into the sea. It is almost impossible to measure how much waste water and industrial waste in our oceans, but we can find out how much oil is poured into them legally and illegally. It is illegal to pour oil into the sea close to the shore, but when a ship is many miles out to sea, there are no such rules. Scientists have different ideas as to the amount of oil putting into the sea, but the lowest figure for oil poured in European waters alone is nearly ,000 tons every year. Some people say the figure could be ten times as high.\n\nIt is not only our coasts that suffer from oil pollution. Many shell fish, for example, now have high amounts of poisonous substances. Next time you have shell fish to eat, how can you be sure that they are free from oil pollution? You cannot see the effects and you cannot taste them, either. It is really quite a problem."

Over millions of years, as climates change and mountains rise, new dry and wet areas develop. But within the last  years, deserts have been growing at a frightening speed. This is partly because of natural changes, but the greatest makers are humans.\n\nHumans can make deserts, but humans can also prevent their growth.

We decided to stop at a local restaurant to get something to eat since we had enough time. When we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as though he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something warm to drink; however, it was not this that I remember, because that is not what \"moved\" me. A dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog owner, I knew that the dog was a mother, and that she had just had some pups. She was hungry and weak and I felt bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her pups would not live. People walking by didn't even notice her. She was not as pretty and clean as most dogs, but she still deserved better. We still did not do anything, but someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went into the store and bought dog food with all the money he had."

With proper planning, though, it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.\n\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness:\n\nDon't skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack. This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.\n\nControl the amount of food. Use a small plate that may encourage you to \"load up.\" You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist.\n\nBegin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables, or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full.\n\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat. Choose lean meat. Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of creamy food.\n\nStick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A -minute walk helps to burn off extra calories. ( words)"

    "extracted_text": "In recent years many countries of the world have been faced with the problem of how to make their workers more productive. Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied. But do more various jobs lead to greater productivity? There is evidence to suggest that while variety certainly makes the worker's life more enjoyable, it does not actually make him work harder. As far as increasing productivity is concerned, then variety is not an important factor.\n\nOther experts feel that giving the worker freedom to do his job in his own way is important, and there is no doubt that this is. The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot easily be given in the modern factory with its complicated machinery which must be used in a fixed way. Thus while freedom of choice may be important, there is usually very little that can be done to create it.\n\nAnother very important consideration is how each worker contributes to the product he is making. In most factories the worker sees only one part of the product. Some car factories are now experimenting with having many small production lines rather than one large one, so that each worker contributes more to the production of the cars on his line. It would seem that not only is degree of the worker contribution an important factor; therefore, but it is also one we can do something about.\n\nTo what extent does more money lead to greater productivity? The workers themselves certainly think this is important. But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring. Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more. A similar argument may explain demands for shorter working hours. Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting, they will neither want more money, nor will shorter working hours be so important to them."

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition and heat-related health problems.\n\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\n\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of  million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by .\n\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was \"a methodological embarrassment\" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable regions. Dr. Pielke said that \"climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention.\" But the report, he said, \"will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed.\"\n\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.\n\nIn a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than % of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report."

Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung, charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\n\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\n\"Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,\" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\n\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save  lost years of life in London and nearly , in Delhi for every million residents, one study found.

We say, \"Nice song.\" \"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.\" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first  minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're married, you're going to lie to your wife/husband in one out of every  communications. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. But look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth about lying: lying's a cooperative act. Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing to lie for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a private secret.\n\nLying is complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and business lives. We're deeply disturbed by the truth. We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives. We're against lying, but secretly we're for it in ways that our society has practiced for centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture and history. Think the stories from Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.\n\nLying has great value to the evolution of human being. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the more likely it is to lie. We human like to become leaders. It starts really early. How early? Well, babies will pretend to cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn hiding truth. Two-year-olds lie outright and try to control via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of covering up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world to be breadwinners, we've entered a world that is just full of fake digital friends, business media, identity thieves, world-class cheats, ---in short, a post-truth society.\n\nWhat do you do? Well there are steps we can take to guide our way through the bushes. Trained lie spotters get to the truth % of the time. The rest of us, we're only % accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are clever liars and stupid liars. There're no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques."

Here's what you need to know to avoid tragedy:\n\n*   Drowning: Each year, thousands of children die from drowning, with two-thirds of accidents occurring in the summer. To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n\n*   Falls: Falls from heights kill  children under the age of  each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision\n\n*   Bikes: Bike accidents kill over , children aged  and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by  percent and brain injury by  percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n\n*   Pedestrian: Over ,000 kids aged  and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under  should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior. Cross at the corner and when you do cross, continue to look both ways because there are likely to be more cars turning into your path or people speeding. Obey all the traffic signals."

Actually, most people experience nervousness at some time or another.\n\nIf you are feeling anxious, my advice is to first find the cause or causes. Make a list of those things that are making you nervous and work out which ones you can do something about. Focus all of your efforts on managing the causes that you can control.\n\nMost people cannot tell the difference between controllable and uncontrollable causes, so things they can't control become a big reason for nervousness. Dealing with this is very important if people want to keep a healthy mind.\n\nSimply try to accept the uncontrollable causes of nervousness. You might be worried about the weather on a big day, an accident or an attack on the train, or perhaps just things that other people are doing at work. The results may be very important but there is still no use worrying because you can't control any of these things. Accept that you can't control everything. Once you understand this, it becomes easier not to worry.\n\nIf a situation, such as swimming, is causing you to be anxious, try to face it as often as possible so that you can get used to it.\n\nIt can often help to think about yourself doing the thing that makes you nervous--then close your eyes and imagine it going well. Imagine how the flight or job interview is going to happen so that you can get used to it. This will help you understand that the thing you fear most is probably not going to happen."

But can medicine come packaged in chicken eggs?\n\nA team of scientists from Scotland say \"yes\". They've engineered special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These eggs come from chickens that have been engineered to produce certain drugs inside their egg whites.\n\nThese drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins -- they're the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good candidates for making protein drugs.\n\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA -- the code that tells cells how to make proteins -- so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs."

To blame the other guy is even more human.\n\nCommon sense is not all that common.\n\nWhy tell the truth when you can come up with a good excuse?\n\nThese three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes, and yet they tell us a lot about human nature. To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do. The original quote about human nature went like this: \"To err is human, to forgive, divine.\" This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite - find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.\n\nCommon sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm, but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine. Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations, because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, \"the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\"\n\nAnd what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time. There is a corollary to that: if good excuse is good even if it isn't honest, then where is the place of the truth?"

At Jackson's trial, although two witnesses testified that Jackson was with them in another location at the time of the crime, he was convicted anyway. Why? The jury believed the testimony of the two victims, who positively identified Jackson as the man who had attacked them. The court eventually freed Jackson after the police found the real criminal.\n\nMany factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses sometimes see photographs of several suspects before they try to identify the person they saw in a group of people. They can become confused by seeing many photographs of similar faces. The number of people in the group, and whether it is a person or a photograph, may also affect a witness's decision. People sometimes have difficulty identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them.\n\nMany people believe that police officers are more reliable than ordinary people. Psychologists decided to test this idea, and they discovered that it is not. Two psychologists showed a film of crimes to both police officers and civilians. The psychologists found no difference between the police and the civilians in correctly remembering the details of the crimes.\n\nDespite all the possibilities for inaccuracy, courts cannot omit eyewitness testimony from a trial. American courts depend almost completely on eyewitness testimony to resolve court cases. Sometimes it is the only evidence to a crime, such as rape. Furthermore, eyewitness testimony is often correct. Although people do sometimes make mistakes, and convict innocent people, more importantly, eyewitness testimony has rightly convicted a larger number of guilty people.\n\nAmerican courts depend on the ability of the twelve jurors, and not the judges, to determine the accuracy of the witness's testimony. It is their responsibility to decide if a certain witness could actually see, hear and remember what happened."

Many people feel that the United States has the worst taxes in the world.\n\nTaxes are the money that people pay to support their government. There are generally three levels of government in the United States: federal, state, and city; therefore, there are three types of taxes.\n\nSalaried people who can earn more than four to five thousand dollars per year must pay a certain part. It depends on their salaries. The federal government has a two-level income tax: that is,  or  percent. $, is the cut off. The tax rate is  percent below $, and  percent above.\n\nThe second tax is for the state government: New York, California, or any of the other forty-eight states. Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government. Of course, the percentage for the state tax is lower. Other states have a sales tax, which is a percentage charged to any item which people buy in the state. Some states use income tax and sales tax to raise their revenues (=annual income).\n\nThe third tax is for the city. This tax comes in two forms: property tax (people who own a home have to pay taxes on it) and excise tax, which is collected on vehicles in a city. The cities use this money for education, police, public works, etc.\n\nSince Americans pay such high taxes, they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes.

Because boys generally have sharper vision/learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given hands-on 'person' where they are allowed to walk around. Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modern type in which violence and sexism are major themes, James wrote.\n\nSingle-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to give in to a stereotype that men should be masterful and in charge in relationships. To mixed schools boys feel pressured to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means, the study reported."

The user is also forced to carry a backpack that holds a control unit and battery to power the motor.

Rather it is intended for people who want to run in a more efficient way. I can't help thinking this cuts down the potential market considerably. After all, most runners I know do it for the sake of their fitness.

As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.**\n\n\"All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'\" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. \"There has been a sea change over the last  years.

But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.\n\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"theNewSchool\".\n\nChanges in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted.

Before you commit years of your life and money to a school, be sure you're choosing a place,\" that is a good match for your personality and interests. You can't get the \"feel\" of a school from any guidebook, so be sure to visit the campus. Below are a few tips for getting the most out of your college visit.\n\n. Explore on your own\n\nOf course you should take the official campus tour, but be sure to allow time to hang around on your own. The trained tour guides will show you a school's selling points. But the st and prettiest buildings don't give you the entire picture of a college. Try to walk the extra miles and get the complete picture of the campus.\n\n. Read the Bulletin Boards\n\nWhen you visit the student center, academic buildings and residence hall, take a few minutes to read the bulletin boards. They provide an easy way to see what's happening on campus. The ads for lectures, clubs and plays can tell you what's going on outside the classrooms.\n\n. Eat in the Dining Hall\n\nYou can get a good feel for student life by eating in the dining hall. Try to sit with students if you can. Do the students seem happy or stressed? Also, is the food good? Are there adequate healthy options? Many admission offices will give prospective students coupons for free meals in the dining halls.\n\n. Visit a Class in Your Major\n\nIf you know what you want to study, a class visit makes a lot of sense. You'll get to observe other students in your field and see how involved they are in classroom discussion. Try to stay after class for a few minutes and chat with the students to get their impressions of their professors and major. Be sure to call in advance to schedule a classroom visit--most colleges don't allow visitors to drop in on class unannounced.\n\n. Talk to Lots of Students\n\nYour campus tour guide has been trained to market the school. Try to talk to students who aren't getting paid to impress you. These important conversations can offer provide you with information about college life that isn't part of the admission script. Few university officials will tell you if their students spend all weekend drinking or studying, but a group of random(CJ) students might.\n\nFor more tips, please go to collegeapps.about.com."

The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. He was also very angry.\n\nPaul Newman's camp counselors () were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n\nThen something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\".\n\nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\n\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his corner to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief. I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\n\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\n\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released.\n\nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\n\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. I said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\n\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\n\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n\nThe show had begun: lights, camera, action.\n\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\n\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. I was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears. After the hug and kiss, he put his hands on my shoulders, and tears filled his eyes, said: \"See you on the other side of the door, Fatha.\""

The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We don't have to travel far away to enjoy the blue sky. We don't have to leave our city or even our neighborhood to enjoy the eyes of a beautiful child. Even the air we breathe can be a source of joy.\n\nWe can smile, breathe, walk, and eat our meals in a way that allows us to be in touch with the abundance of happiness that is available.

Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since , when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n\nNear the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Fernandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\n\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support.\n\nDefoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality. Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe's time."

However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.\n\nPeople in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status, intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress differently for business and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also are intended to communicate messages to members of the same gender.\n\nLong before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.\n\nPutting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor's white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that they can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status. For instance, the strange hairstyle and clothing of the English \"punks\" are essential aspects of their uniforms.\n\nThere are many forms of body decoration other than clothes that are used around the world to send messages. These include body and hair paint, and even body deformation. When doctors put braces on teeth, they are actually doing the same thing - deforming or reforming a part of the body to make it more attractive."

He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\n\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\n\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\n\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at :00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\n\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way, sailor?\" she murmured.\n\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past , she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\n\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\n\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment. \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\n\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\n\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are.\""

    "extracted_text": "**What is the most important thing you've done in your life?**\n\nThe question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\n\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the answer:\n\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October , . I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\n\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\n\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed. Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\n\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\n\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in painful silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\n\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said, \"Thanks for being here.\"\n\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\n\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\n\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\n\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\n\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve."

He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down.\n\nHe knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire.\n\nHe put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets - nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea\n\nAt this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash.\n\nWhile Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said \"Ding-Dong-Dong\", \"Ding-Dong-Dong\" again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises.\n\nWhen he came close to Tom, he stopped.\n\nTom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hello!\" I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\"\n\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working.\n\nBen said, \"Hello, old fellow, you've got to work, hey?\"\n\nTom turned suddenly and said, \"Why, it's you, Ben!\" I wasn't noticing.\"\n\n\"Say -I'm going swimming. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work - wouldn't you? Of course you would.\"\n\nTom looked at the boy a bit, and said \"What do you call work?\"\n\n\"Why, isn't that work?\"\n\nTom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly.\n\n\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\"\n\n\"Oh come, now, you don't mean to say that you like it?\"\n\nThe brush continued to move.\n\n\"Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\"\n\nBen stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said,\n\n\"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.\"\n\nTom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind.\n\n\"No -no -it won't do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don't think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.\"\n\n\"No -is that so? Oh come, now -let me just try.

I'm afraid...\"\n\n\"I'll give you all of it.\"\n\nTom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart. And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun, Tom sat under a tree, eating the apple, and planning how to get more help. There were enough boys. Each one came to laugh, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired, Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite; and when Billy was tired, Johnny bought in for a dead rat -and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, Tom had won many treasures.\n\nAnd he had not worked. He had had a nice idle time all the time, with plenty of company -and the fence had been whitewashed three times. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, Tom would have owned everything belonging to his friends.\n\nHe had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get."

Judy, who was always working on something, was there, so I suggested to her that she ask Flossie to give us a party. She was a new lady who had just moved into Maple Lane and didn't have many friends, or so I thought. In a little town like this, word gets around and it wasn't long before the ladies from the town knew what was going on. They began to ask everyone to come, and in no time at all, we had a list of over 50 addresses. So, on a Saturday night, we had our party. We called it a \"New Dresses\" party, which suited everyone because we all wore new clothes. We danced and laughed for hours and I wore my favorite dress. I was terribly glad it wasn't a failure."

Gather the necessary materials: baking soda, paper, water, a light bulb, a paintbrush, and purple grape juice.\n2. Mix equal amounts of water and baking soda to create a solution.\n3. Use a paintbrush to apply the solution to the paper as invisible ink.\n4. Allow the ink to dry completely.\n\nOnce the ink is dry, it can be read by holding the paper up to a light bulb. The baking soda will react to the light, causing it to turn brown and become visible.\n\nTo add color to the invisible ink, use purple grape juice. This will give the ink a distinctive purple hue, making it easier to distinguish from the surrounding paper.\n\nIt's worth noting that the baking soda solution may not produce a strong enough contrast with the purple grape juice to make the writing completely invisible. However, overall, these steps provide a basic guide to making invisible ink using common household items."

Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\n\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements. Off civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\n\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed.
