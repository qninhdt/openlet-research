With proper planning, though, it’s possible to not eat too much. You don’t have to avoid the foods you enjoy.\n\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness.\n\nDon’t skip meals. Before leaving home, have a small low-fat meal or snack. This may help avoid getting too hungry before delicious foods are served.\n\nCurb the amount of food. Use a small plate that encourages you to use up your food.\n\nBegin with soup or vegetables. Drink a full glass of water before you sit down to help you feel full.\n\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amounts of fat. Avoid high-fat meats. Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. The lemon juice adds flavor.\n\nDon’t let yourself take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk burns off extra calories (238 words)."

Whale \"talking\" can be heard for more than a hundred miles.\n\nYet humans kill over a hundred whales a day. They kill them to make oils and a lot of other things. Killing whales is a modern business. Even harpoons that explode inside the whales inflict a very great pain no one even knows. Some even kill every whale they can.

The number would double by 2050, the study found, primarily through diseases and trends affected by climate change.\n\nProf. Anil Markandya, a lead author of the report, said climate change is the biggest health threat facing humanity today. But he added that the findings should spur action. The report, which has a foreword by Bill Gates, calls for action on climate change.\n\nIn a press release about the report, Prof. Alastair Woodward said we need to work on all fronts. We must recognise that the richest 10% of the global population are responsible for almost half of the emissions from individual lifestyles to help reduce vulnerability in countries whilst addressing the root causes."

Chocolate was first made from the seeds of the cacao tree by South American Indians. The Spanish introduced it to the world quickly after the conquest. Although it was very popular during the 1500s, the potato soon became important. Around 1700, the Spanish brought the potato from Peru to Europe, where it soon was widely grown. Ireland became so dependent on it that when the crop failed during the years 1845-46, thousands died.\n\nThere were many other foods that have traveled from South America to the Old World. Brazil is now the world's largest grower of coffee, and coffee is an important crop in other South American countries. But according to an Arab story, coffee was discovered when a goat keeper named Kaldi noticed that his goats were eating red berries on a coffee tree. He tried one and experienced the wide-awake feeling that one of the world's most popular drinks now gives to people who start the day with it."

The device, which enables runners to use 30% less muscle power, supports the flex of the knee.\n\nComing in a kit, the device consists of a small motor that helps flex the knee, a sensor that detects the knee's degree of flex, and a safety control unit which attaches to the user's leg. The whole device weighs around 5kg, which runners will barely notice—it does not lessen performance when jogging at 25km/h while wearing it. Test subjects say it's nothing special, but they predict they could do it for longer.\n\nCuriously, the makers of the motored knee say it is not designed for the physically handicapped. Rather, it is intended for fit runners. After testing it on efficient runners, this cuts down its potential market—those who want to run for fitness. Most runners say, \"I can't help thinking, for the sake of fitness, wouldn't a device that lets you run longer mean that you don't get the same benefits of the work?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the research team expects to commercialize the kit within the next three years. By that time, they also plan to have made the device significantly smaller and lighter."

She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees. Her great contributions are in three areas.\n\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan, feet and legs were emphasized only, typified by the complex, codified positions of ballet. Possible new ways of dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. It was one of the first.\n\nHer second contribution lies in costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. She wore flowing Grecian tunics, bare feet, and unbound hair.\n\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual practice.\n\nShe was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance."

Recently announced progress marked a major step toward the way people will one day learn by robots or intelligent tutoring systems. ITS are computer systems that provide personalized instruction without human intervention. Facial recognition feedback allows the computer to react accordingly.\n\nThe computer can detect that the system is responding to important cues from the user. Classical ITS have a somewhat rigid architecture. \"If I ask a question—for example, using recognition—then I say more, then I wait for the answer,\" Whitehill said. Feedback from the student to the teacher happens while the robot teacher is talking, Whitehill said.\n\nExperts agree. University of Memphis researcher Dr. Oley, who recently received a U.S. $1 million grant, says the key to future learning is one-on-one instruction. This technology can benefit these advanced learning scenarios, he said.\n\nAlthough robots with speaking abilities have existed for more than 30 years, ITS developments such as Whitehill's and Oley's are pushing the envelope.\n\nThe ITS that have been developed are already better than teachers who have no experience, Oley said."

The research says that they need it from the traditional age of six, when they reach the age to be treated as young men rather than toddlers.\n\nTeachers have traditionally regarded boys from that age onward, but typical teachers want to continue treating them softly. Headteachers need to teach them practical skills, channel their energy, and listen to them. Boys get much-needed physical affection and love it. Activities that help them develop leadership and lead others contribute to turning them into men.\n\nA study of boys when they are young underscores this. The headmaster of Eton noted that boys in Europe are often taught as if they are merely emotional girls, but they are actually emotional too. Girls are emotional, but boys were actually emotional in ways that demand a different approach.\n\nPupils need a strong relationship with a male teacher—or chap—before they can understand this fully. This is what they meant, which ends up making all the difference in their development, as detailed in the British Journal of Psychology."

A researcher dug into the performances of five refs in that match. The researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams. Each ref was on-field for one hour, divided into three periods of 20 minutes during the tournament. Observers noted down the refs' errors, of which there were 250. That's a staggeringly high number of 50 each, and refs made them.\n\nSurprisingly, the researcher found that older refs were more biased when they were close to the incident. When the officials got it right, they were, on average, 17 meters away from the incident. The research shows the optimum distance is 20 meters.\n\nThe research also shows refs were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second. The average speed then was 0.25 m/s. IFAB, football's international law-making body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup. It will encourage refs to keep up with the ball.\n\nThe researcher argues distance rather than rushing up with the ball. He also says fixing this issue with the referees' action is not enough. Their physical condition is critical."
