# Evaluation Rubrics & Level Definitions

You must evaluate each question based on the specific Level Definition it claims to belong to. Use the definitions below as the "Ground Truth".

## Level 1: Retrieval (Basic Information)
*Standard: Elementary Reading Comprehension / Basic Fact-Checking.*
*Goal: Test visual scanning and keyword matching.*

1.  **Question Stem Features:**
    * **Explicit Inquiry:** Ask directly about Named Entities (Who, When, Where, How many, What specific item).
    * **Keyword Mapping:** Include 1-2 anchor words exactly as they appear in the text to allow easy location.
    * **Single-Sentence Focus:** The answer must be found within a single sentence.

2.  **Correct Answer Features:**
    * **Verbatim Extraction:** Copy-paste the exact phrase, number, date, or name from the text.

3.  **Distractor Features:**
    * **Factual Error:** Change the specific number or data point (e.g., change "50%" to "5%").
    * **Jumbled Context:** Use a correct keyword/entity from the text but from a different, unrelated paragraph.
    * **Visual Similarity:** Use words/numbers that look similar (e.g., "1945" vs "1954").

---

## Level 2: Inference & Synthesis (Comprehension)
*Standard: SAT Reading, TOEFL, IELTS (High Band).*
*Goal: Test understanding of meaning, connection, and paraphrasing. Defeat "keyword scanning".*

1.  **Question Stem Features:**
    * **Synthesis:** Require combining information from at least 2 different sentences/paragraphs (e.g., A causes B, B causes C -> What is relation between A and C?).
    * **Paraphrased Inquiry:** **DO NOT** use keywords from the text. Use synonyms or rephrased descriptions.
    * **Global Comprehension:** Ask about Main Idea, Author's Purpose, Tone, or Implied Meaning ("It can be inferred that...").

2.  **Correct Answer Features:**
    * **Semantic Equivalence:** The answer must mean the same as the text but use completely different vocabulary/structure (Translation of meaning).

3.  **Distractor Features (CRITICAL):**
    * **The Verbatim Trap (Copycat):** Options that contain **exact keywords** from the text but are factually incorrect or misused. (This traps Level 1 models).
    * **Partial Truth:** One part is correct, the other part is false.
    * **Causality Confusion:** Reversing cause and effect.
    * **Over-generalization:** Changing "some" to "all/always".

---

## Level 3: Critical Reasoning & Abstract Logic (Application)
*Standard: LSAT Logical Reasoning, GMAT Critical Reasoning.*
*Goal: Test logic, application, and critical evaluation. Identify logical structure independent of content.*

1.  **Question Stem Features:**
    * **Abstraction & Application:** Create a **Hypothetical Scenario** NOT mentioned in the text and ask to apply the text's rules/principles to it.
    * **Logical Evaluation:** Ask for Underlying Assumptions, Logical Flaws, or Strengthening/Weakening evidence.
    * **Structural Mapping:** Ask to identify a parallel argument with the same logical structure.

2.  **Correct Answer Features:**
    * **Necessary Consequence:** Must be logically deduced.
    * **External Validator:** Can introduce NEW information (for strengthen/weaken questions) that logically impacts the argument.

3.  **Distractor Features (CRITICAL):**
    * **The "So What?" (Irrelevance):** Facts that are true (even mentioned in text) but do not logically affect the specific argument being made.
    * **Out of Scope:** Generalizations that go beyond the text's evidence context.
    * **Reverse Causality:** Confusing the direction of logic.
    * **Emotional Trap:** Options that sound ethically/politically correct but are logically irrelevant.


# Scoring Metrics

For **EACH** question, provide an analysis on 3 metrics. **You must provide the Reasoning BEFORE the Score.**

### 1. Solvability (Binary: 0 or 1)
* **Criteria:**
    * Is there exactly **one** correct answer?
    * Is the correct answer actually correct based on the text/logic?
    * Is the question clear and unambiguous?
    * Is the question free from hallucinations (info not in text and not a valid L3 hypothetical)?
* **Score:** `1` (Pass), `0` (Fail - Ambiguous, Wrong Answer, No Answer, or Hallucinated).

### 2. Distractor Quality (Scale: 1-5)
* **Criteria:** Rate how effectively the distractors implement the **Specific Distractor Features** defined for the Target Level.
* **Score:**: `1` to `5` (1=Poor, 5=Excellent).
  
### 3. Alignment (Binary: 0 or 1)
* **Criteria:** Does the question strictly follow the features of its **Target Level**?
* **Score:** `1` (Aligned), `0` (Misaligned).

# Output Format

For each question, provide the evaluation strictly following the template below. Use the Example as a reference for the expected length and style of the "Reasoning".

### Template

### Question [Insert Question Number]
Level: [1 to 3]
1. Solvability:
- Reasoning: [Brief explanation: Is the answer correct/unique? Is it hallucinated?]
- Score: [0 or 1]
2. Distractor Quality:
- Reasoning: [Brief evaluation: Do distractors use the specific traps (e.g., Verbatim Trap for L2, Irrelevance for L3)?]
- Score: [1 to 5]
3. Alignment:
- Reasoning: [Brief check: Does the question strictly match the Question Stem & Answer features of the Target Level?]
- Score: [0 or 1]

### Example Output (Reference Only)

### Question 1
Level: 2
1. Solvability:
- Reasoning: The question has a clear logic derived from paragraph 2. Option C is the only correct inference.
- Score: 1
2. Distractor Quality:
- Reasoning: Option A uses a "Verbatim Trap" (exact words from text but wrong meaning), which is excellent for Level 2. Option B is a plausible partial truth.
- Score: 5
3. Alignment:
- Reasoning: The question uses synonyms instead of keywords (Paraphrased Inquiry) and requires combining two sentences (Synthesis). It aligns perfectly with Level 2.
- Score: 1
